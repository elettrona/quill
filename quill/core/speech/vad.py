"""Voice-activity detection for conversation turns (Hey QUILL refinement).

Pure, wx-free, stdlib-only: decide when a spoken turn has *ended* by watching
the microphone's energy, so a conversation turn finishes when you stop talking
rather than after a fixed window (the ADP "silence window", WCAG 2.2.1). The UI
feeds successive PCM-16 mono chunks to :class:`SilenceDetector`; when speech has
been heard and then silence has persisted for the configured window, the
detector reports the turn is done and the UI stops the recording and
transcribes.

Energy is plain RMS over 16-bit samples — no numpy, no model. That is enough to
tell "someone is speaking" from "the room is quiet" for turn-taking; it is not
speech recognition and never leaves the machine.

    """Streaming end-of-turn detector fed successive PCM-16 mono chunks.

    The speech threshold **calibrates to the room**: the first
    ``calibrate_ms`` of audio are treated as the ambient noise floor, and a
    chunk counts as speech only when it rises a clear margin above that floor
    (``speech_over_floor`` times it), never below ``speech_rms``. This keeps a
    noisy mic — a real-hardware pass found a USB headset idling at RMS ~700,
    above the old fixed 500 floor — from reading its own hiss as endless
    speech. Real speech runs several thousand RMS, so the margin is wide.

    ----------
    sample_rate:
        Frames per second of the incoming audio.
    silence_ms:
        Trailing quiet needed to end a turn once speech has been heard.
        ``0`` disables detection (:meth:`feed` never reports done).
    speech_rms:
        Absolute floor for the speech threshold (used when the room is quiet).
    min_speech_ms:
        Minimum total speech before trailing silence can end the turn.
    calibrate_ms:
        Leading audio measured as the ambient noise floor (0 disables
        calibration and uses ``speech_rms`` directly).
    speech_over_floor:
        A chunk is speech when its RMS exceeds ``ambient_floor`` times this.
