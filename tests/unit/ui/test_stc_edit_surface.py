"""The "Notepad++ experiment" surface (wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl / Scintilla).

Contract-level tests (no live wx): the setting round-trips, the combo offers
the surface under the agreed label, the Experimental-tab explainer covers it,
MainFrame dispatches it, and the wrapper shims the four contract gaps the
probe found (see edit.md, "stc" section): EVT_TEXT never fires natively,
ChangeValue leaves the buffer modified, SetInsertionPoint drags the anchor,
and CRLF passes through unconverted.
