"""Environment-driven configuration for the QUILL AI Gateway.

Everything that must never appear in source control (the OpenAI API key,
the database URL, the Redis URL, the Flask session secret) is read from
environment variables here and nowhere else in the codebase. See
``.env.example`` at the repository root for the full list of variables a
deployment must set, and ``README.md`` for how they get there in practice
(an env file *outside* this git-tracked directory, or your host's native
secret-injection mechanism).

This module intentionally does *not* read a ``.env`` file itself in
production — use ``python-dotenv`` only for local development (see
``run.py``), so a forgotten ``.env`` file can never accidentally ship
inside a deployed environment.
