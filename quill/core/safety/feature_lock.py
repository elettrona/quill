"""Remote feature kill switch — local persistence and enforcement state (wx-free).

Signed feature advisories ride inside the update manifest
(:mod:`quill.core.updates`). This module turns the advisories that apply to the
running version into a locked set, persists it atomically in the app data dir so
a kill switch **survives offline and across restarts** (a lock you can only
reach while online would be useless during an incident), and exposes the small
state object the UI consults in ``_feature_enabled``.

Design guarantees:

- **Fail-safe, one direction.** A lock can only make a feature *unavailable*; it
  never enables or runs anything. Enforcement is a plain membership test.
- **Persistent once received.** The locked set is cached locally and honored on
  the next launch even with no network. It clears only when a later verified
  manifest no longer lists the feature (or the escape hatch below is used).
- **Local escape hatch.** Setting ``QUILL_IGNORE_FEATURE_LOCKS=1`` disables all
  remote locks for that run — for an administrator who must use a feature the
  advisory disabled, or to recover if an advisory is ever wrong.
