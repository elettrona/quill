"""The QUILL AI Gateway: a small, boring, private Flask service that owns
the real OpenAI key so the open-source QUILL desktop client never has to.

See ``docs/planning/openai.md`` at the repository root for the full
product requirements document this implements — read that first if
you're new here. This package is the reference implementation of its
§24 API contract.

Application-factory pattern (``create_app``), matching the convention
already used by the sibling ``quillin-hub/`` service in this repository,
so both services are operated the same way on the same host.
