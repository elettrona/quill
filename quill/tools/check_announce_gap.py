"""Announce-gap gate (GATE-12).

Prevents the regression where a dialog updates a status StaticText via
``SetLabel`` without announcing the change to screen readers (finding #43
from the 2026-06-12 golden-state review).

A file is flagged when ALL of the following are true:
  1. It lives under ``quill/ui/`` or ``quill/devtools/``.
  2. It assigns a wx.StaticText to a variable whose name contains one of the
     status-signal words: status, progress, info, msg, error, hint.
  3. It calls ``.SetLabel(`` somewhere (updating a control label).
  4. It contains NO announcement calls: ``_announce(``, ``announce_cb``,
     or a standalone ``announce(`` call.

This gate is intentionally narrow: it only catches the systemic gap pattern
(silent status-text updates) and does NOT flag every SetLabel call, since
many are legitimate (button labels, column headers, display names).

Run directly::

    python -m quill.tools.check_announce_gap

Or via pytest (``tests/unit/tools/test_announce_gap.py``). Exit code is
non-zero when any violation is found.

ALLOWLIST: add entries here for known-safe files where SetLabel is used
legitimately without announce (e.g., purely navigational path labels that
are backed by a list control whose selection event already announces, or
files where a positional ``announce`` parameter name differs from the
detection pattern).
