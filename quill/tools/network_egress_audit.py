"""No-silent-network gate (GATE-9).

Every outbound network call in Quill must be deliberate, reviewed, and tied to
an explicit user action or an explicitly consented background check. This gate
inventories every egress call site in the ``quill`` package via AST and fails if
a new one appears that is not recorded in ``_REVIEWED_EGRESS`` with a rationale.

The rationale for each site documents *what triggers it* and *why it is not a
silent call* (a user action, a visible progress/consent surface, or an opt-in
setting). A reviewer adding a new network call must add it here, which forces a
conscious decision and a code-review touchpoint.

This is the structural half of GATE-9. The runtime half — asserting the AI chat
path shows provider, model, and scope before any cloud call — lands with the
provider-wiring work (AI-13), where that call path first exists.

# PyGithub egress — manually documented (not AST-scannable)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PyGithub (github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) makes HTTPS calls internally via
# urllib3.  Its call sites never appear in quill/ source as direct
# urllib/socket/requests calls, so the AST scanner cannot find them.
# The integration surface is documented here for auditability.
#
# Entry points (all in quill/core/github/github_provider.py):
#   get_identity()    - GitHub API: GET /user
#   get_repository()  - GitHub API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}
#   list_refs()       - GitHub API: GET branches + tags for a repo
#   get_file()        - GitHub API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}
#   save_file()       - GitHub API: PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}
#
# Gating: all calls are triggered by explicit user actions in the GitHub
# dialogs (File > Open from Remote > GitHub).  A one-time consent dialog fires
# before any network call on first use.  Tokens are stored in Windows Credential
# Manager only, never logged.  All PyGithub calls are HTTPS.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pip subprocess egress (on-demand engine installs) — manually documented
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The three optional speech-engine installs below each run the runtime's own pip
# in a subprocess (`python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --target <user dir>
# <pkg> ...`).  The network call is performed by pip reaching PyPI / pythonhosted,
# not by an urlopen in quill/ source, so the AST scanner above cannot see them;
# they are documented here for auditability.
#
# All three share the same gating pattern: explicit user action only, behind a
# visible confirmation and progress dialog, blocked in Safe Mode, wheel-only
# (no build backend / arbitrary code), installed into a user-writable engine-pack
# folder (no admin), no silent path.
