"""Build a Windows distribution of Quill.

Outputs under ``windows-distribution/``:

* ``portable/`` — the runnable bundle (launcher, manifest, README, the
  Quill package source, and optionally an embedded Python runtime with
  all required wheels pre-installed).
* ``installer/quill.iss`` — an Inno Setup script that turns the portable
  bundle into a polished Windows installer (per-user by default, Start
  Menu shortcut, optional Desktop shortcut, optional Open-With entries,
  proper Add/Remove Programs metadata).

The ``--bundle-python`` flag downloads the official Windows embeddable
Python distribution and pre-installs ``wxPython`` and ``pyttsx3`` into
it, so end users do **not** need to install Python or pip themselves.

# still installs the safe GLOW seam. Re-add "glow" here when GLOW is re-enabled
# and its wheels are published.
# "speech" bundles sounddevice (PortAudio) so offline dictation works out of the
# box (#617) without a separate pip install. The whisper.cpp engine itself is a
# separate InnoSetup component (tools/speech/whispercpp), not a pip wheel.
# Vosk (the very-low-resource CPU-only offline engine, #669) is NOT bundled: at
# ~51 MB of self-contained wheel (it ships libvosk) it is the single largest optional
# engine, and it is not the default (whisper.cpp is). Like Faster Whisper it downloads
# on demand into a user-writable engine pack (quill/core/speech/engine_install.install_vosk,
# activated on sys.path) via Tools > Speech > Download Vosk, so the base installer no
# longer carries it. Its ~40 MB model still downloads on demand via Manage Speech Models.
# The default whisper.cpp engine is itself already on-demand (~8 MB, excluded from the
# installer in quill.iss and fetched via release_assets / the dictation pre-flight), so no
# offline engine is bundled -- the installer stays small and the first offline use fetches
# the tiny default in-flow.
# "feedback" bundles feedback_hub (direct GitHub issue submission) so Report a
# Bug offers the accessible Submit flow instead of the browser support form.
# "kokoro" is intentionally NOT bundled: kokoro-onnx pulls in onnxruntime (large),
# phonemizer, espeakng-loader and babel. Kokoro is an on-demand feature -- its
# models already download on first use, and install_kokoro_onnx() pip-installs the
# package tree into an engine-pack (activated on sys.path), so bundling it just
# bloated the installer. Keeping it out trims the installer substantially and lets
# babel arrive with the on-demand install (#881). See the guided-installer spec.

            Quill is a screen-reader-first writing, reading, review, and document-intelligence
            environment for Windows. It is designed to stay calm on the keyboard while still
            giving power users deep navigation, structured editing, comparison, GLOW review,
            diagnostics, and optional external-tool workflows.

            Optional tool onboarding is built into Quill itself. If Pandoc, Tesseract OCR,
            or other supported tools are installed or bundled, Quill explains what they unlock
            and offers guided touch points such as the Pandoc Conversion Wizard.

            (portable mode). Choose portable if you are running Quill from
            a USB stick or a managed work laptop where AppData is volatile.
