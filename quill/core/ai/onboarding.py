"""AI onboarding model — a magical, frictionless first run for QUILL's AI (wx-free).

This is the brain of the AI Setup Wizard: the welcome, the one real decision (how
should AI run?), the friendly provider choices, the celebration of what just became
possible, and the persisted state (was setup done, and is the user in the gentle
**Basic** experience mode). It holds no wx — the wizard dialog drives it and applies
the chosen configuration through the existing settings/provider functions, so the
whole flow is unit-testable and the copy lives in one reviewable place.

Design promises: no jargon, no dead ends, no broken configurations. Every path can be
finished or skipped in seconds; the on-device path verifies a usable local Ollama
before it commits (``ollama_status``) so the user is never left "configured but not
working"; and the wizard's "keep it simple" checkbox puts a newcomer in Basic mode.
