"""Packaging-dependency invariants.

These guard a class of "green tests, broken build" bugs where a package that a
*default* feature needs at runtime is declared only in an optional extra (or the
dev extra). Dev and CI install those extras, so import-based tests pass -- but the
shipped runtime, which installs only the base dependencies, is missing the package
and the feature fails at first use. See the beta-2 speech-engine fixes:

- huggingface_hub: the default whisper.cpp speech-to-text engine downloads its
  GGML models via huggingface_hub.hf_hub_download, so it must be a base dep.
- Babel: the Kokoro ONNX voice chain (kokoro-onnx -> phonemizer -> segments ->
  csvw -> babel.numbers) needs it; it must ride with the [kokoro] extra, not only
  [dev].
