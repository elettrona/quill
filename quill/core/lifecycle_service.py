"""Process-wide model-lifecycle service — wires the policy into the running app.

A wx-free singleton holding one :class:`~quill.core.model_lifecycle.ModelLifecycleManager`
built from the user's settings, so the speech, TTS, and LLM model holders can register
their load/unload with a single idle-unload + low-resource policy **without** importing
wx or each other. ``main_frame`` builds it at startup (:func:`configure`) and runs the
idle sweep on a timer; the model holders call :func:`note_loaded` / :func:`touch` /
:func:`note_unloaded` / :func:`reserve` around their own warm/unload.

Every call degrades to a safe no-op when the service is unconfigured (headless tests,
or before startup), so a registration site can never crash. Model holders wrap their
existing unload as a plain callable — the service adapts it to the manager's
``Unloadable`` protocol — so no holder needs to know about the manager type.
