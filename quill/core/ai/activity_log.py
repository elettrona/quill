"""AI activity / audit log (PRD §9, §14 — first-class reviewable surface).

Every gateway tool call, permission decision, and applied patch is recorded here
as a structured, redacted entry so the AI Hub's Activity tab can answer "what did
the AI do, and can I undo the last change?" without exposing document content or
secrets.

This is wx-free core. Entries persist atomically as a bounded JSON list under
``<data>/ai-activity/activity.json`` (newest last). Free-text fields pass through
:func:`quill.stability.redaction.redact_text_for_bundle` before they are stored,
and by default we record *scope*, not raw document content (PRD §9 "scope, not
raw content, by default").
