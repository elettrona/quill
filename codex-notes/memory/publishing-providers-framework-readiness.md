# Publishing Providers Framework Readiness

## 2026-06-19 follow-up phases opened

- added `codex-notes/notes/publishing-follow-up-phases-2026-06-19.md`
- opened the follow-up roadmap in this order:
  - WordPress first-party bundled provider package path
  - schedule publish
  - local-vs-remote compare/sync
  - live third-party publishing provider loading
- live third-party provider loading remains last because it depends on SEC-8/policy, consent, network, conflict, and validation gates
- recommended first implementation slice: define the bundled-provider adapter contract
## 2026-06-19 framework readiness tightening

- reviewed the active plan and confirmed the current publishing framework scope is ready for a branch readiness checkpoint
- current scope includes provider metadata, connection/auth model, secure secrets, endpoint validation, provider/client seam, WordPress reference provider, browse/open/create/update/publish lifecycle, remote identity, operation capabilities, and validation gates
- deferred items are explicitly not blockers for the current framework checkpoint:
  - WordPress extraction as a first-party bundled Quillin/provider package
  - schedule publish
  - local-vs-remote compare/sync model
  - live third-party publishing provider loading
- recommendation: stop adding speculative framework machinery and move to review/readiness unless a concrete review gap appears
Status: active upstream implementation checkpoint on `feature/publishing-providers-framework`, tracking `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`, with current upstream `main` at `7a64564`, merge/conflict recovery represented by HEAD `cbe5ed6`, provider registry seam in place, operation capability metadata added, provider/client validation implemented, provider metadata contract validation added, and the internal tool gate wired into local pre-commit plus PR CI, remote item editor identity implemented, publish-now and open-remote publish lifecycle actions added, focused validation green, current framework scope marked ready, and WordPress extraction direction and blocker note recorded as deferred follow-up.

## 2026-06-19 WordPress extraction blockers

- added `codex-notes/notes/wordpress-provider-extraction-readiness-2026-06-19.md`
- recorded that WordPress remains the in-tree reference provider for now
- blockers before extraction:
  - package-facing provider registration contract
  - explicit lifecycle bridge from publishing core to bundled provider package
  - preserved network consent/no-silent-network review
  - host-owned secret storage/access
  - provider validation before user-facing exposure
  - provider-neutral shell/UI wording
  - SEC-8 third-party loading remains locked off
  - performance and reliability measurement for provider adapter calls
- no product runtime behavior changed

## 2026-06-18 provider/client contract validation

- added provider metadata contract validation through `validate_publishing_provider_definition(...)`
- the publishing provider registry gate now checks metadata and clients together
- contract checks now catch:
  - implemented auth method not listed as supported
  - implemented content kind not listed as supported
  - implemented operation not listed as supported
  - unknown auth method ids
  - unknown operation ids
  - missing singular/plural labels for implemented content kinds
- WordPress remains the in-tree reference provider; no runtime third-party publishing provider loading was added
- validation passed:
  - focused publishing core tests: `24 passed in 0.69s`
  - focused provider gate tests: `5 passed in 0.21s`
  - wider publishing/tool/module-size slice: `58 passed in 4.23s`
  - direct provider gate command: `Publishing provider/client registry is valid.`
  - `pre-commit run publishing-provider-registry --all-files`: passed
- full unit suite after this slice: `3738 passed, 11 skipped, 53 failed, 2 warnings`
- remaining full-suite failures/skips/warnings are outside the touched provider-contract slice and remain out of scope

## 2026-06-18 provider validation CI/local wiring

- wired `python -m quill.tools.check_publishing_providers` into the existing local/CI gate collections
- local hook added: `publishing-provider-registry` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- PR CI internal-gates job now runs the publishing provider registry gate directly
- PR CI internal-gate unit-test bundle now includes `tests\unit\tools\test_check_publishing_providers.py`
- validation passed:
  - direct tool command: `Publishing provider/client registry is valid.`
  - focused publishing-provider tool tests: `5 passed in 0.37s`
  - internal-gate bundle: `56 passed in 11.76s`
  - `pre-commit run publishing-provider-registry --all-files`: passed
- full unit suite after this slice: `3732 passed, 11 skipped, 53 failed, 2 warnings`
- remaining full-suite failures/skips/warnings are outside the touched CI/local publishing-gate slice and remain out of scope

## 2026-06-18 provider validation tool gate

- added internal `python -m quill.tools.check_publishing_providers` gate for provider/client registry validation
- the gate surfaces validation without loading third-party publishing providers or exposing runtime Quillin provider loading
- focused tool tests passed: `5 passed in 0.21s`
- wide publishing/tool/module-size slice passed: `52 passed in 3.56s`
- full unit suite after this slice: `3731 passed, 11 skipped, 54 failed, 2 warnings`
- remaining full-suite failures/skips/warnings are outside the touched provider-validation/tooling slice and remain out of scope

## 2026-06-18 testing discipline

- user set the working rule that every development/code slice must receive focused validation plus the broad available unit-test battery
- in-scope failures must be fixed before committing that slice
- unrelated failures/skips/warnings from merged main or environment-sensitive areas should be recorded but not fixed unless the current slice touches those areas
- commit locally as each step is completed; do not push unless explicitly requested
- latest full unit baseline after provider/client validation extraction: `3726 passed, 11 skipped, 54 failed, 2 warnings`
## 2026-06-18 provider/client validation

- implemented the planned provider/client registration validation slice
- added validation helpers in `quill/core/publishing_validation.py`:
  - `PublishingProviderValidationIssue`
  - `validate_publishing_provider_client(...)`
  - `validate_registered_publishing_provider_clients(...)`
- validation now reports provider definitions with no clients, clients with no provider definitions, and declared operations whose required client method is missing
- tests cover clean built-in registration, missing client, orphan client, and operation/client-method drift
- validation passed:
  - focused: `20 passed in 0.59s`
  - broader core publishing: `39 passed in 3.89s`
- next likely work should remain extraction-prep focused: decide where this validation is surfaced for bundled/future providers before any WordPress extraction or live Quillin provider loading
## 2026-06-18 upstream access and branch recovery

- user reports the head developer granted push access and resolved conflicts before creating the current branch
- current remote is upstream: `origin https://github.com/community-access/quill`
- current active branch: `feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- current tracking branch: `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- current HEAD: `cbe5ed6 Merge branch 'features/publishing-providers-framework' of https://github.com/stickbear2015/quill into feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- current `origin/main` / `main`: `7a64564 chore(docs): drop relocated 0.5.0 release notes and old verbosity plan`
- working tree was clean before this recovery documentation update
- historical fork-only instructions below are preserved as history, but the active branch workflow is now upstream `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- merge commit records conflict resolution across module budgets, dialog/public-surface fixtures, menu contract tests, import ordering, and a power-tools wiring slice boundary
- merge commit records precommit gates green: ruff format, ruff check, banned-pattern, dialog escape-button contract, module-size budget, and announce-gap gate
- merge commit records test results:
  - `tests/unit/ui/` 690/690 pass
  - `tests/unit/core/` 2544 pass + 4 skipped + 11 thesaurus timeouts deselected
  - 12 `test_brf_page_detection.py` failures are documented as pre-existing on `origin/main` and unrelated to this merge
- next work should continue from the existing provider-neutral framework plan rather than recreate the old fork branch state
- do not continue into the next implementation slice yet; tighten docs/review notes around the recovered merge and known residual test state first

## 2026-06-18 fork push and upstream PR

- fork branch pushed:
  - `stickbear2015:features/publishing-providers-framework`
- upstream pull request created:
  - `https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/pull/268`
- target:
  - `Community-Access/quill:main`
- current sync instruction:
  - push notes/log updates to the fork remote only
  - do not push directly to upstream until the user has the needed access

## 2026-06-18 provider operation capabilities

- added explicit provider operation capability metadata for:
  - verify
  - browse
  - load
  - update
  - create
  - publish
- WordPress declares all current operations because it remains the in-tree reference provider
- core publishing actions now check operation support before calling provider clients
- publish-now and publish-open-remote now require the provider `publish` operation instead of assuming publish is available whenever create/update exists
- fake second-provider coverage proves a provider can verify without browse/publish support, and the framework reports capability gaps instead of falling through to WordPress-shaped behavior
- focused verification passed:
  - `122 passed in 42.70s`

## 2026-06-18 remote publish lifecycle

- added provider-neutral `publishing.publish_remote_item` for promoting an already-open remote publishing item through the existing review-first update flow
- File > Publish now exposes `Publish Open Remote Content...`
- implementation keeps the shell provider-neutral:
  - command id uses `publishing.*`, not WordPress wording
  - UI validates the tab's stored provider/site metadata before sending
  - core routes status promotion through `PublishingProviderClient.update_remote_item(...)`
- extended the provider client update seam with optional `status`
- WordPress reference client includes `status: "publish"` only when promotion is requested; normal remote update payloads remain title/content only
- no new dialog class was added; the existing confirmation/message-box path is reused
- focused verification passed:
  - `120 passed in 62.51s`

## 2026-06-18 publish-now lifecycle

- added provider-neutral publish-now actions after the break:
  - `publishing.publish_current`
  - `publishing.publish_current_page`
- File > Publish now exposes `Publish Post Now...` and `Publish Page Now...`
- implementation reuses the same create-provider client path with `status="publish"`
- no WordPress-specific shell behavior was added
- no new custom dialog was added; the existing review-first confirmation and result message path is reused
- focused publishing/governance validation passed after documenting measured module-budget growth:
  - `119 passed in 32.58s`
- next likely work:
  - consider publish/promote of already-open remote drafts if product wants a remote-item lifecycle action
  - otherwise continue hardening the provider/client contract toward future first-party Quillin extraction

## 2026-06-18 break-ready sync

- latest local implementation commits before sync:
  - provider registry and verification seam
  - WordPress future first-party Quillin direction
  - remote item editor identity
- latest focused validation:
  - `117 passed in 62.98s`
- push requested by user so remote can match the local clean checkpoint
- next likely work after break:
  - provider-neutral publishing lifecycle behavior
  - or deeper browse scaling if that becomes the preferred next slice

## 2026-06-18 remote item editor identity

- implemented the next planned remote identity slice
- generic `Document.name` now supports metadata-backed display names for pathless documents
- local paths still take precedence, so normal file-backed documents are unchanged
- publishing remote opens now preserve the provider-returned title as:
  - `display_name`
  - `publishing_remote_title`
- publishing tabs can receive a generic source label from metadata
- publishing create/update success refreshes the stored remote title/display name from the returned provider document
- no fake temp/local file path was introduced; remote-linkage truth remains in source metadata
- focused publishing/governance validation passed after documenting measured module-budget growth:
  - `117 passed in 62.98s`
- next likely plan work:
  - continue provider-neutral publishing lifecycle behavior on top of the registry and identity seams
  - consider deeper progressive browse loading only if product wants more browse scaling before provider extraction work

## 2026-06-18 WordPress first-party Quillin direction

- architecture note recorded in the active publishing plan
- current implementation should keep WordPress in-tree as the reference provider while the framework contract is still being proven
- desired extraction destination:
  - WordPress becomes a trusted first-party bundled Quillin or equivalent built-in extension package
  - it registers through the same provider/client seam as future providers
- immediate implementation rule:
  - do not move WordPress yet
  - do keep all shell, dialogs, and publishing actions provider-neutral
  - keep WordPress-specific endpoint/auth behavior inside provider metadata/client code
- next implementation slice remains `Remote Item Editor Identity`

## 2026-06-18 provider registry and verification seam

- implemented the planned framework-neutrality seam before adding more publishing behavior
- provider metadata and provider clients now both have explicit registration functions
- `PublishingProviderClient` now owns `verify_connection(...)`
- WordPress verification moved into `WordPressPublishingClient`
- unknown providers no longer fall back to WordPress:
  - metadata helpers return empty/default-neutral values for missing providers
  - publishing actions report the provider as unregistered
- fake second provider regression coverage proves the shell verifies through the registered provider client instead of assuming WordPress for app-password auth
- network-egress review entry now points at `core/publishing_clients.py::verify_connection`
- focused publishing/governance validation passed:
  - `113 passed in 31.29s`
- next likely plan work:
  - `Remote Item Editor Identity` for clearer tab/title identity on opened remote items
  - then continue provider-neutral publishing lifecycle behavior on top of the registry seam

## 2026-06-18 provider-neutral publishing copy

- cleaned up the provider-boundary audit findings
- browse surface now uses `Browse Publishing Content` / `Publishing content` wording instead of `Published content`
- provider metadata now owns content-kind display labels and plural labels
- browse content-scope choices are generated from provider-supported content kinds
- core/provider-client messages now say `publishing content` where drafts can be included
- focused publishing/governance verification passed after documenting measured module-budget growth:
  - `111 passed in 32.46s`
- next likely plan work:
  - `Remote Item Editor Identity` for clearer tab/title identity on opened remote items
  - or deeper progressive browse loading beyond partial-result wording

## 2026-06-18 browse partial results

- continued `Browse Remote Content Scaling`
- WordPress browse now preserves partial results when multiple content kinds are requested and one kind fails after another succeeds
- partial-result wording names the failed content kind and says to retry with a narrower content scope
- all-failed and single-kind failed browse still fail normally
- focused publishing/governance verification passed:
  - `110 passed in 31.38s`
- next likely plan work:
  - complete remaining browse scaling with deeper progressive UI/loading work, if desired
  - or move to `Remote Item Editor Identity` for clearer tab/title identity on opened remote items

## 2026-06-18 publishing confirmation model

- implemented the next plan-directed confirmation refinement after browse status scope
- create/update publishing success messages now use `publishing_result_message`
- result copy includes:
  - target site
  - content kind
  - title
  - resulting status, with WordPress `publish` rendered as `published`
  - returned remote link when available
- existing pre-send confirmation prompts remain in place and no new dialog surface was introduced
- `MainFrame` now shows the structured result in the native message box and only the first line in the status bar
- focused publishing and governance verification passed after documenting measured module-budget growth:
  - `109 passed in 32.31s`
- next likely plan work after this checkpoint:
  - continue `Browse Remote Content Scaling` with progressive loading / timeout-aware partial results
  - or move into `Remote Item Editor Identity` for clearer tab/title identity on opened remote items

## 2026-06-18 browse status scope

- implemented the first next-step browse refinement from the plan addendum
- browse now includes drafts by default instead of silently limiting the list to published content
- the browse dialog exposes an explicit `Status to browse` choice with visible label and accessible name
- publishing dialogs now receive MainFrame's announcement callback so status text updates satisfy current main's GATE-12 screen-reader announcement rule
- focused publishing plus current-main governance validation is green:
  - `106 passed in 51.90s`

## 2026-06-18 main merge refresh

- `origin/main` advanced to `2a92c03` and has been merged into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- the integrated branch keeps publishing as a provider-aware content workflow under `File > Publish`
- current main's adjacent work is also retained, including the new AI menu flag, 0.6.0/Quillin/power-tools/UI updates, stricter dialog/message-box gates, and regenerated UI snapshots
- publishing dialogs now use the shared message-box wrapper instead of raw `wx.MessageBox`
- focused publishing plus merge-sensitive validation is green:
  - `124 passed in 55.82s`
- no push has been performed for this checkpoint

## 2026-06-12 planning-language correction

- updated the latest publishing planning note so it does not imply Quill is being designed only for blind users
- corrected wording now reflects the intended product stance more accurately:
  - accessibility-first
  - strong non-visual feedback
  - broader audience than a single user group
- no product behavior changed in this pass

## 2026-06-12 cleanup note

- post-sync workspace cleanup is complete
- stray repo-local guidance drift has been corrected
- local temp/cache noise from validation reruns has been removed
- readiness judgment is unchanged:
  - publishing integration is still in good shape on current upstream
  - next meaningful product work is still `Update Remote Content...`

## 2026-06-12 upstream resync update

- refreshed from current `origin/main` and merged that updated `main` back into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- synced `main` tip during this pass: `97d04f6`
- major newly integrated upstream themes include:
  - developer console / QDC
  - GitHub remote file access
  - autoupdate / deployment work
  - help, translation, setup-wizard, copy-tray, prompt-library, and abbreviation surfaces
- publishing integration still reads cleanly after that newer shell churn:
  - GitHub Remote uses `File > Open from Remote`
  - publishing still uses `File > Publish`
  - publishing command mappings coexist with newer developer-console command mappings

## 2026-06-12 validation update

- publishing-owned plus merge-sensitive branch slice passed after the new sync
- result:
  - `129 passed in 19.12s`

Validated areas included:

- publishing core and browse/open flows
- feature mapping and feature visibility
- remote-sites persistence/dialogs
- main-frame characterization
- file-menu contract for publishing placement
- dialog inventory and banned-pattern gates
- budget gate and adjacent menu/wiring/status-bar contracts

## 2026-06-10 final state update

- current branch is `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- current branch history now includes merge of the latest observed `origin/main` work as of 2026-06-10:
  - `54cef8c` Node.js runtime / QDC tutorial / installer component work
  - `106ef2c` editor menu consolidation / notebook store groundwork
  - `d394863` notebook workspace UI layer
- branch-owned publishing and merge-sensitive verification slice last passed at:
  - `87 passed in 9.85s`
- Codex support documents have been centralized under `codex-notes/`
- branch is in a good reviewable state, but direct merge to `main` is still not the recommended next step

## Current recommendation

- okay for visibility / draft PR discussion
- not ideal yet for final merge to `main`

Why:

- publishing foundation, connection management, and browse/open flows are in place
- approved content-representation behavior is implemented
- but the explicit `Update Remote Content...` lifecycle step is still the next intended product slice
- branch also carries process/support documentation that may deserve scoping before any final `main` merge

## 2026-06-10 audit update

- `fork/main` has been resynced to `origin/main`
- `features/publishing-providers-framework` has been merged with current `main`
- the branch is no longer planning-only; it already contains publishing foundation, connection management, and browse/open implementation work
- publishing now enters through `File > Publish`, not a top-level `Publishing` menu
- browse/open now supports the approved representation choice:
  - default `Readable Markdown`
  - per-open override `Raw HTML`
  - automatic fallback to `Raw HTML` when conversion would be misleading or lossy
- publishing-open metadata now records the chosen Quill authoring surface explicitly so later update work can stay honest about Markdown-authored versus HTML-authored remote tabs

## Git state

- Repo: `C:\code\git-src\quill`
- Branch: `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- local historical notes below may mention older merge points; latest meaningful branch state is the merged-and-documented state above
- latest documentation-only cleanup commits after the merge include:
  - `249ba49` `docs(codex): record merge readiness assessment`
  - `08f3677` `docs(codex): centralize notes and planning artifacts`
  - `1b65db4` `docs(codex): record clean push checkpoint`

## Source of truth

- Planning spec: `codex-notes/plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
- Tracking issue: `#140`
- Issue URL: `http://github.com/community-access/quill`
- Product source of truth: `docs/QUILL-PRD.md`

## Pre-coding guardrails

- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/QUILL-PRD.md`.
- Keep the implementation simple, accessible, and powerful by reusing existing Quill patterns.
- Preserve the approved `File > Publish` menu direction from the current plan.
- Support both posts and pages.
- Keep network actions explicit, review-first, and never silent.
- Keep publishing behind feature gating until the implementation is ready.
- Do not add memory or process notes under the existing product docs tree unless explicitly requested.

## Existing patterns the implementation should reuse

- Feature definitions and command gating in `quill/core/features.py` and `quill/core/feature_command_map.py`
- Command registration via `quill/core/commands.py`
- Menu wiring in `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
- Top-level menu definitions and menu customization in `quill/ui/main_frame.py` and `quill/core/menu_customization.py`
- Dialog patterns from `quill/ui/assistant_tools.py`
- Dialog governance from `dialogs.md` and `quill/tools/dialog_inventory.py`
- Notification storage in `quill/core/notifications.py`
- Verified TLS and no-silent-network expectations in `quill/core/net.py` and `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`
- About-surface contributor pattern in `quill/ui/main_frame.py`
