"""Public product-name and branding constants for QUILL.

This module centralises the strings that identify QUILL in user-facing
surfaces (About dialog, Help menu, README, installer metadata, support
bundles, crash reports). Internal code identifiers (Python package name
``quill``, settings paths, data directories) are intentionally not
renamed - changing those would break saved settings, keymaps, and
extension manifests.

Constants:

* :data:`APP_DISPLAY_NAME` - full public name, ``"QUILL for All"``.
* :data:`APP_ORGANIZATION` - publisher, ``"Community Access"``.
* :data:`APP_FULL_NAME` - organisational form, ``"QUILL for All by
  Community Access"``.
* :data:`APP_SHORT_NAME` - short form after first use, ``"QUILL"``.
* :data:`APP_DESCRIPTION` - one-line description.
* :data:`APP_COPYRIGHT` - copyright line.
* :data:`APP_LICENSE_NAME` - the project's license name.
* :data:`QUILL_KEY_LABEL` - user-visible brand name for the QUILL Key
  chord prefix (``Ctrl+Shift+Grave``). Surfaced in menus, the About >
  Keyboard Reference page, status bar messages, and the cheat sheet
  in the form ``"QUILL Key + <second-key>"``. The stored binding
  grammar (``"Ctrl+Shift+Grave, <X>"``) is unchanged; only the display
  label moves. See ``quill.core.keymap.format_binding_for_display``
  for the rewrite helper.
* :data:`INDEPENDENCE_NOTICE` - the multi-line text asserting that
  QUILL for All is not affiliated with similarly named projects.

The independence notice is intentionally calm and factual. It is not a
legal statement; it is risk-reduction language agreed with the
maintainers so that the project can continue to use its name while
making the scope of the project clear to users.
