"""Direct Windows SAPI 5 speech via comtypes (the pyttsx3 replacement).

QUILL drives Windows text-to-speech through the SAPI 5 ``SpVoice`` COM object
directly rather than through pyttsx3. pyttsx3's SAPI driver is a thin, fragile
wrapper around this same object whose ``runAndWait()`` reuse bug forced an
external-loop workaround, and whose ``init()`` could deadlock across threads.
Talking to ``SpVoice`` ourselves removes the dependency and gives reliable file
synthesis (``SpFileStream``) for previews and batch export.

COM threading: a ``SpVoice`` is an apartment-threaded object. comtypes calls
``CoInitializeEx`` on first use per thread, so each helper here creates and uses
its ``SpVoice`` on the calling thread. Long-lived use (the announcement worker)
must build the voice on the same thread that speaks with it -- see
``prism_bridge``.

Voice identifiers are SAPI token IDs (the registry path), which is exactly what
pyttsx3 exposed as ``voice.id`` -- so settings saved under the old engine keep
working.

Windows-only; importing on other platforms degrades to ``available() == False``.
