"""Drive a document end-to-end to a chaptered speech file (§4.8 glue).

This is the missing production seam between the structure-aware extractor
(:func:`quill.core.speech.text_polish.extract_sections`) and the chapter
assembler (:func:`quill.core.speech.chapter_assemble.assemble_chaptered_audio`).
The assembler deliberately takes an **injected** synthesizer so a real engine and
the test fake share one path; this module resolves a chosen engine/voice into that
synthesizer and runs the whole pipeline:

    document -> extract_sections -> assemble (per-engine synth + sounder) -> WAV/MP3

It is ``wx``-free and strict-typed (it lives in ``quill/core``), so the future
batch UI and headless callers can share exactly this resolution logic rather than
re-deriving it. Local engines (SAPI 5, Kokoro, Piper, DECtalk, eSpeak-NG) plus the
multilingual cloud providers (OpenAI / Gemini / ElevenLabs) for translated export.
