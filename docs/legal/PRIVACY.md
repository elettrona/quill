# Privacy Statement

This document describes how QUILL handles privacy for local and AI-assisted workflows.

## Core privacy commitments

1. QUILL is local-first by design.
2. QUILL does not persist AI chat session transcripts by default.
3. QUILL does not send network requests without explicit user action.
4. QUILL does not store document content in API-key storage or credential vault records.

## AI interaction data

When you use cloud AI providers, the prompt content you choose to send is transmitted to that provider. Provider-side storage, retention, and policy behavior are controlled by that provider's terms and settings, not QUILL.

QUILL does not persist Ask Quill chat transcripts or Writing Assistant interaction transcripts by default. If you explicitly copy output into a document, that content is then part of your document and saved according to your normal file and backup workflow.

## Key and credential handling

QUILL stores API keys using Windows Credential Manager when available. If Credential Manager is unavailable, QUILL falls back to DPAPI-encrypted local secret storage.

QUILL does not store API keys in plaintext.

## Local files QUILL may create

QUILL may create local settings and state files under your app data directory (for example `%APPDATA%\Quill\...`), including:

- editor and application settings
- onboarding state
- feature and UI preferences
- optional encrypted secret metadata

These files are local to your machine and are not uploaded by default.

### Developer Console history

If you use the QUILL Developer Console (QDC), each command you run is appended to a `history.jsonl` file in the app-data directory (up to 500 entries; oldest are removed first). Entries are passed through QUILL's redaction layer before being written, so API keys and tokens that match known patterns (GitHub PATs, OpenAI keys, AWS access keys, Slack tokens, and long alphanumeric tokens) are replaced with `[TOKEN]` in the history file.

If you believe sensitive data was stored before the redaction layer was active, you can delete the `history.jsonl` file from the app-data directory manually.

### GitHub temporary files

When you open a file from a GitHub repository using **File > Open from Remote**, QUILL downloads the file into a `github-temp` subdirectory of the app-data folder. These files are not automatically deleted when you close the tab or exit QUILL.

If you work with private repositories, review the `github-temp` directory periodically and delete files you no longer need. The directory is local to your machine and is not shared or uploaded.

### Read Document in Browser (experimental)

The optional **Read Document in Browser** feature (off by default, under **Settings > Experimental**) writes a self-contained reader page containing your document text to a `browser-reader` subdirectory of the app-data folder and opens it in your web browser. QUILL itself makes no network request for this feature, and the page is deleted when you close QUILL so no plaintext copy is left behind.

Be aware that the browser's speech voices are not all local. On-device voices (labelled "on this device" in the page's voice picker) synthesize speech locally. The browser's "Online (Natural)" voices synthesize in the voice vendor's cloud (for example, Microsoft Edge's online voices), which means selecting one sends the text being read to that service. Choose an on-device voice to keep everything local.

## User responsibility

You are responsible for reviewing AI-generated output before using, sharing, or publishing it. For sensitive content, use local models when possible and verify that cloud use meets your organization's security and compliance requirements.
