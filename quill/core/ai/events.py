"""Normalized agent event types (Streaming Event Bridge — PRD §14).

Every harness (the native loop today; optional SDK packs later) produces wildly
different streams. This module defines the single, harness-neutral event
vocabulary they are normalized into, so the accessibility layer has exactly one
set of events to map to balanced screen-reader announcements.

This is the wx-free core. The UI subscribes to these events and decides how
loudly to speak them (honoring the verbosity setting); token deltas are
summarized, never spoken one by one.
