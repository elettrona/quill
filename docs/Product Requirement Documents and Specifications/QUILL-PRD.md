## 1. Vision

Quill is a focused writing and document-reading workstation for blind and low-vision users. It opens almost anything, turns it into clean, navigable text in a familiar Windows edit field, and gives the writer a quiet, predictable place to think.

1. **Open by default.** Free, open source, with no proprietary scripting layer required. Works first class with NVDA out of the box, and equally well with JAWS or Narrator.
2. **Screen-reader-native.** Every surface is a standard Windows control (`wx.TextCtrl` multiline, `wx.ListBox`, `wx.Dialog`) so MSAA, UIA, IAccessible2 and braille routing all just work. No custom drawn controls in the writing path.
3. **Magical, not flashy.** "Magic" means the right thing happens without ceremony. PDFs become readable. Bookmarks survive edits. Backups are automatic. The command palette knows what you mean. Nothing surprises the screen reader.
4. **Local first, cloud optional.** Heavy lifting (PDF extraction, OCR, layout repair, spell checking) runs locally when possible. Cloud assistance is opt-in per action, transparent, and never silent.

If a sighted person watched a Quill user work, they would see almost nothing on screen. That is the point.

---

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Provide a dependable plain-text writing surface that NVDA, JAWS and Narrator can read without quirks.
- Open a wide range of document formats and present them as editable text in a standard edit field.
- Preserve the original source file. Extracted or rendered text saves through "Save As" so originals are never overwritten.
- Offer practical writer tools: find and replace, bookmarks that survive edits, magical spell check, word count, page navigation, multiple documents, backups, recent files.
- Offer a discoverable command palette modelled on Visual Studio Code so users do not need to memorise every shortcut.
- Let every shortcut be reassigned through a friendly keymap editor.
- Offer optional, transparent AI assistance for awkward PDFs, scanned images and broken layouts.
- Integrate cleanly with Windows: file associations, "Open with", jump lists, taskbar.
- Be themable for low vision (high contrast, large fonts) without breaking screen-reader behaviour.

### 2.2 Non-goals

- Not a visual word processor. No bold, italic, fonts, colour styling in the writing surface for v1.
- Not a desktop publishing tool.
- Not a replacement for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer.
- Not a book reader with pagination and reflow. Quill renders documents as editable text.
- Not an AI chat product. AI is used only to repair reading order or extract text.

### 2.3 Update Strategy and Micro-Updates

Quill uses `app_updater` (AccessibleApps, MIT license) for cross-platform incremental updates, enabling smaller, faster patches:

- **Incremental delivery**: Updates are distributed as small ZIP packages containing only changed files, not full reinstalls.
- **Automatic bootstrapper**: Platform-specific bootstrappers (`bootstrap.exe`, `bootstrap-mac.sh`, `bootstrap-lin.sh`) apply updates atomically after app exit and restart.
- **Accessible UX**: Update checks and progress are announced through the screen reader with clear prompts for user consent.
- **Backwards-compatible install**: Full installers (Inno Setup on Windows, `.dmg` on macOS) remain available for fresh installs or offline scenarios.
- **Signed feeds**: Update feeds are cryptographically signed (Ed25519 or RSA) to prevent tampering; signatures are verified client-side.

This enables shipping bug fixes and security patches as micro-updates without re-downloading the entire application, while maintaining security and platform best practices.

#### 2.3.1 Remote feature kill switch (signed feature advisories)

QUILL can **remotely disable a feature** if a serious problem is found after
release, without shipping a new build. This is a safety valve, deliberately
narrow and fail-safe.

- **Transport.** Kill switches ride as `advisories` inside the *existing* signed
  update manifest (`quill/core/updates.py`), so they inherit its protections and
  add **no new network path or consent surface**: HTTPS only, a trusted-host
  allowlist, and a signature the client verifies. The advisories are part of the
  signed canonical form, so they cannot be added or altered in transit; a feed
  with no advisories keeps its exact prior signature (backward-compatible).
- **Capability (one direction only).** An advisory can only make a known feature
  id (`quill/core/feature_command_map.py`) *unavailable*, for a version range
  (`min_version`/`max_version`). It can never enable, execute, or reconfigure
  anything. The worst a forged advisory could do — if signing were ever broken —
  is disable a feature, which the user can override locally. This keeps the
  mechanism from becoming a remote-control attack surface.
- **Enforcement (at dispatch, not per handler).** Locks are enforced at the
  command **dispatch** chokepoint — `CommandRegistry.run` consults a gate before
  invoking any handler, so **keybindings and the command palette** (which both
  route through it) are blocked uniformly rather than relying on each handler to
  self-check. Menu items whose feature is locked are **disabled** on every menu
  build (so their click and accelerator are inert). A blocked command surfaces a
  plain-language "turned off by a safety update" notice. `_feature_enabled` also
  consults the locks, so any handler self-check stays correct too.
- **Dependency cascade.** A lock propagates through the feature dependency graph
  (`FeatureDefinition.dependencies`): a feature is effectively locked when it, or
  anything it transitively depends on, is directly locked. Locking a parent
  (e.g. `core.editor`) therefore disables everything built on it — mirroring how
  `FeatureManager` disables dependents when a feature is turned off — so an
  advisory never leaves a half-working subtree. The dependency graph is gated as
  acyclic with all dependencies defined (`check_feature_tags`).
- **Portable builds covered.** Portable builds fetch the signed manifest for
  advisories too (they only skip its installer URL for the update *prompt*), so
  a kill switch reaches them and, crucially, can be lifted on them.
- **Persistence & fail-safe.** The locked set is cached locally
  (`quill/core/safety/feature_lock.py`) and honored on the next launch **even
  offline** — a kill switch you can only reach while online would be useless
  during an incident. It clears only when a later verified manifest drops the
  advisory (or the running build moves past its `max_version`), which is how a
  fix lifts the lock.
- **Consent & escape hatch.** Locks apply when the user's update check runs
  (the same consent that governs update checks). `QUILL_IGNORE_FEATURE_LOCKS=1`
  disables all remote locks for that run — for an administrator who must use a
  disabled feature, or to recover if an advisory is ever wrong.
- **Publishing.** The owner manages locks with `scripts/manage_feature_locks.py`
  — an accessible console (run it with no arguments for a numbered menu, or use
  `--list` / `--add <id> --reason "…" [--max-version X]` / `--remove <id>` /
  `--publish`). Every `--lock-feature`/`--add` id is **validated against the
  feature catalog before signing** (a typo hard-fails with suggestions, so an
  incident lock can't silently no-op). It edits only the feed's `advisories`,
  re-signs with the same `QUILL_UPDATE_MANIFEST_KEY` used for releases (verifying
  the result before it writes), and `--publish` runs git add/commit/push on the
  feed. Lifting a lock
  is `--remove` (or a `--max-version` below the fixed build). `generate_update_feed.py`
  also accepts the same `--lock-feature` flags when regenerating a full feed.

## 3. Target users and primary scenarios

### 3.1 Personas

1. **Mira, blind university student.** Reads PDF lecture notes daily. Needs them to make sense linearly, with reliable search and bookmarks she can name.
2. **Ade, blind technical writer.** Writes long Markdown and HTML. Wants to write in a quiet edit field, preview structure in a browser, and export cleanly.
3. **Pat, blind admin assistant.** Opens invoices and Word documents from email. Wants to copy reference numbers and totals quickly.
4. **Sam, low-vision novelist.** Uses Narrator with a large font and high contrast. Writes long manuscripts, restores from yesterday's backup occasionally.
5. **Jamie, blind sysadmin.** Edits INI, JSON, log and config files. Wants a calm editor that does not fight tooling.

### 3.2 Primary scenarios

- Open a 30-page PDF invoice, find the payment reference, copy it.
- Start a blank document, write a 2000-word article in Markdown, preview it in the browser, export to Word.
- Open a DOCX from a colleague, read it, save the extracted text as a `.txt` for archival without touching the original.
- Open a scanned receipt, ask Quill to OCR it through a cloud service, get a plain text rendering.
- Restore the version of `chapter-7.md` from two saves ago.
- Reassign `Ctrl+G` from Go To Line to Go To Bookmark because the user prefers a different convention.

---

## 4. Product principles

1. **The edit field is sacred.** The writing surface is a standard multi-line `wx.TextCtrl`. Nothing exotic. Screen readers see plain text. Always.
2. **Predictable keyboard.** Shortcuts match Windows conventions where they exist. New shortcuts are documented, discoverable, and reassignable.
3. **Speak the result, not the process.** After every meaningful action, Quill announces a short, useful result through the screen reader.
4. **Originals are read-only by default.** Anything rendered or extracted saves through Save As. Plain-text formats save in place.
5. **No silent network calls.** Any cloud assistance asks first, shows progress, and reports the outcome.
6. **Quiet by default.** No surprise toasts. No animated UI. No tabs that announce themselves on every switch. Cues that merely duplicate what the screen reader already says ship **off**: e.g. `announce_dialog_transitions` (the spoken "Entered/Exited *name* dialog") defaults to off, since every supported reader already announces a dialog and reads its title on focus. The lever stays in **Preferences > Accessibility** for anyone who wants the extra cue. Settings reach existing users on upgrade because the on-disk store is a delta from code defaults (see `settings_migration`), so a changed default flows to everyone who never deliberately overrode it.
7. **Recoverable.** Backups happen on save. Crash recovery on launch. Nothing the user wrote should ever be lost.
8. **Discoverable.** A searchable command palette lists every action with its current binding.

## 5. Functional requirements

### 5.1 Application shell

- Single window per running instance, with multiple documents inside.
- Three primary regions, always present: **menu bar** (5.1a), **central editor**, **status bar** (5.1b).
- Window title shows `document-name [modified] – Quill`. The word "modified" appears only when the document has unsaved changes.
- Tray icon optional, off by default.
- No splash screen.
- **Single-instance mode** is on by default. A second launch with a path opens that path in the existing window and brings it to the foreground. A setting allows multi-instance for advanced users.
- **F6 region cycling** moves keyboard focus through the three regions in order (editor → menu bar → status bar → editor). `Shift+F6` cycles in reverse. The region name is announced on entry ("Status bar"). If the Outline Navigator (5.16) is pinned, it joins the cycle between editor and menu bar.
- All regions are stock wx controls (`wx.MenuBar`, `wx.TextCtrl`, `wx.StatusBar` with a custom layout) so MSAA/UIA expose them correctly without scripts.

### 5.1a The magical menu bar

The menu bar is standards-based, predictable, and exhaustive. Every menu item is also a command in the palette, every item shows its current keybinding to the right of its label, and the displayed binding updates live when the user rebinds it. No menu item is hidden; disabled items remain visible with a short tooltip explaining why they are disabled in the current context.

Menu structure:

- **File**: New/Open/**New from Clipboard**/Open Recent/Open from URL, **Open from Remote / Save to Remote / Save Copy to Remote / Manage Remote Sites** (FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, S3 — verified TLS, host-allow-listed, explicit consent, screen-reader announcements), **Snapshots** (save/open workspace snapshot), **Notebook** submenu (**New Notebook / New from Folder / Open Notebook / Save Snapshot / Manage Snapshots** — multi-document workspace with entries panel, daily goal, and named snapshots), Save/Save As/Save All/Save as plain text, Reload/Restore backup, print flows, **Run current file / Open target at cursor / Rename / Delete current file**, close/exit.
- **Edit**: Undo/redo, clipboard (including **Paste HTML as Markdown**), **Find/Replace plus Find Next/Previous/All Matches**, selection helpers, **delete-to-line/document and delete-paragraph**, link insertion/follow, and **Recent Marks (Ring)** with plain-language labels.
- **View**: shell behavior, theme and visual controls (preference toggles such as persistent undo, spell-check-as-you-type, word prediction, dark mode, tray mode, title-path and dirty-title style now live in **Settings**).
- **Insert**: table/list/code/footnote/tag insertion helpers plus **special character, date and time, calculated date, and file content**.
- **Format**: case/comment/indent controls, rich text and heading controls, and a single **Transform Lines** submenu (number/hard-wrap lines plus sort/reverse/dedup/whitespace/indentation conversions).
- **Navigate**: line/page/bookmark movement, heading/block/structure movement, outline, bracket match, region movement, **go to percent / first / last non-blank**, and **Go to Entry / Heading / Bookmark / Sticky Note in Notebook** (cross-entry navigation when a Notebook is open).
- **Search**: in-files Find and Replace-across-files, plus **regex count/extract matches and block set-operations** (line filtering by block membership).
- **Tools**: regrouped into discoverable submenus (≤ 2 levels deep):
  - Sticky Notes
  - Writing and Language
  - Read Aloud
  - Integrations
  - Document Intake
  - AI Assistant *(demoted from top level; promotable back via Customize Menus)*
  - Authoring and Automation
  - Macros
  - Compare Documents
  - Accessibility *(includes cursor address / document status / selection-length status queries)*
  - Support
  - Customize
  - Power Tools *(editor-behavior power toggles grouped together where no other menu is a natural home)*
  - Quillins *(includes **Text Tools** for line transforms/regex and **Insert Tools** for date/time placeholders)*
- **Window**: document/tab management actions.
- **Help**: contextual help, onboarding docs, feature profile support, updates, and About.

All menu strings are translatable. Every menu item has a unique mnemonic. The menu bar may be hidden via View; when hidden, pressing `Alt` reveals it temporarily and `Esc` dismisses it again, matching Windows convention.

### 5.1b The magical status bar

The status bar is not a passive label strip. It is a fully keyboard-navigable row of items that any user can reach with `F6` and arrow through with Left and Right. Each item is a small interactive cell, and `Enter` on a cell either toggles a state, opens a chooser, or runs a related command. This is modelled on Visual Studio Code's status bar, adapted for screen-reader-first interaction.

Design rules:

- **Container**: a custom layout inside `wx.StatusBar` composed of small `wx.Window`-derived focusable buttons (`wx.lib.agw.AquaButton` style is rejected; we use plain `wx.Button` with flat styling). Each cell exposes itself as an MSAA button with name, role, value, and description so NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator read it as a real interactive control.
- **Reachable**: `F6` from the editor moves focus into the status bar at the cell the user last interacted with (or the leftmost cell on first entry). Left/Right arrow moves between cells with wrap-around. `Home`/`End` jump to first/last. `Esc` returns focus to the editor. Tab and Shift+Tab also move between cells inside the status bar.
- **Announced**: when focus enters the status bar, the region name and the focused cell are announced ("Status bar, Line 12, Column 7, button"). Cells announce their value when arrowed to.
- **Activated**: `Enter` or `Space` triggers the cell's primary action. `Shift+F10` or the Application key opens a context menu of related actions for that cell. Right-clicking is equivalent.
- **Live updates**: cell values update without stealing focus. Updates marshal via `wx.CallAfter` and use a debounced single accessibility event per cell per 200 ms to avoid speech spam.
- **Hideable per cell**: a context menu item "Hide this item" tucks any cell behind an overflow group. Overflow is reached at the right end ("More items, button"); Enter opens a small list of hidden cells, any of which can be restored.
- **Plugin-extensible** (v1.1): plugins may register status-bar cells with the same MSAA contract.

Cells shipped in v1.0, in left-to-right order:

| Cell | Default value | Primary action (Enter) | Context menu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Document name** | `chapter-7.md` or `Untitled 1` | Opens Quick Switcher (palette `~`) | Switch document, Reveal in Explorer, Copy Path, Close |
| **Modified state** | `Modified` / `Saved` | Save | Save, Save As, Reload From Disk, Restore Backup |
| **Line / Column** | `Line 12, Column 7` | Opens Go To Line | Go To Line, Go To Page, Go To Bookmark |
| **Selection** | `Selection: 3 lines, 47 words` or hidden when no selection | Opens Document Statistics on selection | Statistics on selection, Convert case…, Sort selected lines |
| **Word count** | `1,248 words` | Opens Document Statistics on document | Statistics, Configure reading rate |
| **Page** | `Page 4 of 23` (only when document has page markers) | Opens Go To Page | Next page, Previous page, Page list |
| **Search term** | `Find: "reading order"` (only when a search term is set) | Opens Find with the term pre-filled | Find Next, Find Previous, Find All, Clear Search |
| **Encoding** | `UTF-8` | Opens Reload With Encoding | Reload With Encoding, Save With Encoding, Auto-detect |
| **Line endings** | `LF` / `CRLF` / `CR` | Cycles to the next style and prompts to confirm | Choose explicitly, Convert on save |
| **Indent** | `Spaces: 4` / `Tabs` | Opens indent settings | Convert to tabs, Convert to spaces, Set width |
| **Language** | `en-GB + tech + personal` (the active spell-check dictionary stack) | Opens dictionary stack chooser | Add dictionary, Pin to document, Per-paragraph (v1.2) |
| **Spell check** | `Spell check on` / `Spell check off`. When errors exist: `3 errors` | Toggles as-you-type spell check | Run spell check, Jump to next misspelling, Reset learning |
| **Read aloud** | `Read aloud: ready` or `Read aloud: speaking` | Toggles read-aloud playback | Voice…, Speed…, Read selection, Read document |
| **Accessibility audit** | `Audit: clean` or `Audit: 2 warnings` (only after a manual or auto audit) | Opens the Issues panel | Run audit, Configure rules, Ignore for this document |
| **AI status** | `AI: Ready` / `AI: Needs attention` / `AI: Not checked`, with a short detail line | Opens AI provider settings | Verify connection, Switch provider, View last response |
| **Background tasks** | `Idle` or `Extracting PDF, 42%` | Opens a small Tasks dialog listing in-flight operations with Cancel | Cancel all, Show task log |
| **Notifications** | `No new messages` or `2 messages` | Opens the Notifications dialog (release notes, available updates, backup recovery offers) | Dismiss all, Open Notifications |
| **Quill** (rightmost) | `Quill 1.0` | Opens About | Check for Updates, Release Notes |

Default visibility: Document name, Modified state, Line/Column, Word count, Encoding, Line endings, Spell check, Background tasks, Notifications. Other cells are present but tucked into overflow until first relevant use; they auto-surface when their context becomes relevant (for example Page appears as soon as a paged document is opened; Search term appears the moment a search term is set).

When title mode is configured to show the full file path, Quill suppresses a duplicate file-path status item to avoid repeated location noise.

### 5.1c Trust and verification

Quill explains what it did, how confident it is, and how to recover if extraction looked wrong.

- **Document Intake Report**: every non-plain-text open announces a short, screen-reader-friendly summary and exposes a full report with format, engine, page/sheet/slide counts, OCR use, AI use, confidence, detected structures, and sidecar path.
- **Copy With Source**: selected text can be copied with source location appended (file, page/line/column, engine, confidence) and the source map stays available for future citations.
- **Extraction quality review**: PDF-derived documents expose page-by-page confidence warnings and allow retry/review flows.
- **Cleanup recipes**: deterministic review-and-apply transforms for OCR/PDF cleanup (dehyphenate, remove headers/footers, normalize ligatures, line reflow).
- **Report Bad Extraction**: creates a support package with version, metadata, and no document content unless the user explicitly opts in.
- **What Can I Do Here?**: context-sensitive help for the current surface, available from the Help menu and command palette.
- **Safe mode**: a startup-safe mode disables plugins, experimental features, AI integrations, startup restore, background indexing, file watchers, custom themes, custom snippets, and network services for troubleshooting.
- **Portable mode clarity**: portable builds can store settings locally next to Quill.exe or in AppData, with a first-run choice and an independence command.
- **Golden document corpus**: release testing includes a canonical corpus of PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, Markdown, HTML, and OCR samples with expected extraction and announcement snapshots.

### 5.1f Profile safety and recovery

Feature profiles must be safe, explainable, reversible, and recoverable.

- **Why don’t I see this?** explains why a named feature is hidden, quiet, unavailable, or gated by the current profile.
- **Profile switch preview** shows visible, quiet, and off features before applying a profile change.
- **Undo last profile change** is available from Notifications after a profile switch.
- **Emergency reset to Essential** is available from launch and from the recovery flow.
- **Profile health check** validates feature IDs, dependencies, visibility paths, and profile JSON integrity.
- **Feature-coverage gate** fails CI when commands, menus, cells, pages, or help topics lack a valid feature ID.
- **Profile-aware keyboard reference** can filter to current profile, quiet features, off features, or diff views.
- **Shortcut wiring is consistent across the product.** Commands exposed in menus, the command palette, and the keymap editor must all resolve to the same accelerator path, including proofread, translate, compare-navigation, and dark-mode commands.
- **Profile-aware welcome guide** adapts onboarding to the active profile.
- **Privacy and network labels** declare local-only, external-helper, metadata-only, and network-sending features.
- **Feature maturity labels** distinguish core, stable, advanced, helper-required, and unavailable features.
- **Profile import safety** schema-validates profiles and prevents silent enablement of recovery-sensitive features.
- **Show what changed** produces a plain-text summary after profile switches.

### 5.1g Feature registry and user profiles

Quill’s feature-profile system is a first-class product surface, not a cosmetic preference layer.

- **Feature Registry**: a central registry assigns every feature an id, category, description, default state, dependencies, conflicts, privacy impact, network impact, accessibility notes, and profile tags.
- **Profile layering**: user overrides sit above custom profiles, shipped profiles, default registry state, and locked safety rules.
- **Shipped profiles**: Essential, Casual Writer, Author or Student, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, Full Quill, and Custom.
- **Settings UI**: Profiles and Features page with search, feature table, explain/related commands, compare profiles, and profile management actions.
- **Custom profile creation**: users can create named custom profiles, select a parent shipped profile, and optionally inherit that parent's feature baseline.
- **Bare-bones start**: custom profile creation also supports an explicit non-inherited baseline (locked core safety features only), with a warning before commit.
- **Quick profile picker**: `Alt+Shift+P` opens fast switching for built-in and custom profiles.
- **Onboarding**: first run asks how Quill should start and chooses a profile.
- **Command/menu/status/help integration**: feature IDs govern command palette, menus, status-bar cells, settings rows, help topics, and format handlers.
- **Dependency enforcement**: enabling a feature can enable required dependencies; disabling a feature warns about affected features.
- **Storage**: feature flags and profiles are stored locally as JSON and can be imported/exported safely.
- **Safety rules**: locked-on features cannot be disabled by shipped profiles, custom profiles, imported profiles, plugins, or user overrides.
- **Feature metadata**: each feature declares risk, maturity, privacy, and network labels for use in settings and help.

### 5.1d Power search, regex, and special characters

Search and Unicode cleanup are first-class accessibility features, not power-user extras.

- **Search modes**: Find, Find All, Replace, Replace All, Find in Selection, and saved search recipes support plain text, whole word, regular expression, and wildcard modes.
- **Regex helper**: a screen-reader-friendly helper provides recipe presets, plain-language explanations, editable sample text, live match previews, and copy-pattern actions.
- **Plain-English errors**: regex errors are reported in single-sentence form with character positions and no traceback.
- **Match review**: users can review captured groups for a match, including named groups.
- **Replace preview**: Replace All shows a preview before applying, with undo as one step.
- **Saved searches**: common search/replace recipes can be stored with mode, scope, and description.
- **Special characters**: the Find dialog can insert special search tokens for tabs, line endings, non-breaking spaces, zero-width characters, smart quotes, ellipses, bullets, and Unicode character classes.
- **Character Inspector**: reports the character under the cursor by name, code point, category, and common encodings.
- **Invisible character view**: users can switch to an inspection view that describes invisible characters textually.
- **Unicode cleanup**: normalization and cleanup commands remove or rewrite common noisy characters with a preview first.

Menu and window stability requirement:

- **Menu mutation guard**: while native menus are open, Quill defers menu label/check/enable mutations and applies them on menu close. This avoids crash-prone churn during rapid keyboard menu navigation.

### 5.1e Feature flags and profiles

Quill should stay calm by default and unlock power features intentionally.

- **Feature states**: `on`, `quiet`, `off`, `locked on`, `locked off`.
- **Core stays locked on**: editor, open/save, backups, crash recovery, help, accessibility announcements, settings.
- **Advanced features can be quiet/off**: regex search, regex helper, saved searches, OCR, AI repair, document intake reports, extraction review, character tools, compare/diff helpers, diagnostics, plugin surfaces.
- **Profiles**: Essential, Casual Writer, Author or Student, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, Full Quill, Custom.
- **Settings**: a Profiles and Features page lets the user switch profiles, compare them, and expose quiet features when desired.
- **Command/menu gating**: menus, palette entries, status-bar cells, help topics, and settings pages only surface features appropriate to the active profile.

### 5.2 Documents and the editor

- The editor is a multi-line `wx.TextCtrl` with `wx.TE_MULTILINE | wx.TE_RICH2 | wx.TE_NOHIDESEL | wx.TE_AUTO_URL`. `wx.TE_RICH2` is used only for selection and undo behaviour, not styling.
- UTF-8 internally. Line endings preserved on open, normalised to platform default on new documents.
- Soft wrap on by default; toggle with `Alt+Z`.
- Standard editing: cursor movement, selection, clipboard, undo and redo, all via the native edit control.
- `Ctrl+Delete` deletes the next word; `Ctrl+Backspace` deletes the previous word; result announced.
- Case conversion: `Ctrl+Shift+U` upper, `Ctrl+L` lower, `Ctrl+Shift+T` title. Selection if present, otherwise whole document.
- Multiple documents: `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` cycle. Switching announces document name only.
- Close current document: `Ctrl+W` or `Ctrl+F4`. Prompt to save if modified.
- Exit: `Alt+F4` on Windows, `Cmd+Q` on macOS. Prompts for each modified document.
- Quill does not restore previous documents on launch by default. Opt-in setting available.

### 5.2a QUILL Quick Nav mode

Quill provides a browse-style, cursor-only navigation mode for long-form reading and structural movement in editable text surfaces.

- Activation: `Ctrl+Shift+Grave` enters QUILL Quick Nav mode.
- Exit: `Esc` exits QUILL Quick Nav mode.
- Direction rule: pressing `Shift` with a Quick Nav key reverses direction.
- Editing rule: no editing commands run while Quick Nav mode is active.
- Status rule: status bar reports Quick Nav mode state while active.
- Auto-exit rule: find and replace entry points return to normal command mode automatically.

Default Quick Nav keys:

- `H` / `Shift+H`: next and previous heading.
- `1` to `6` / `Shift+1` to `Shift+6`: next and previous heading at level 1 through 6.
- `A` / `Shift+A`: next and previous link anchor.
- `L` / `Shift+L`: next and previous list container.
- `I` / `Shift+I`: next and previous list item.
- `T` / `Shift+T`: next and previous table.
- `Q` / `Shift+Q`: next and previous block quote.
- `B` / `Shift+B`: next and previous bookmark.
- `'` / `Shift+'`: next and previous code block.
- `C`: open table of contents (outline navigator).
- `P` / `Shift+P`: next and previous paragraph.
- `S` / `Shift+S`: next and previous sentence.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: next and previous block.

Artifact tracking model:

- Quill maintains an in-memory navigation index per active document.
- Index key: full document text plus markup kind.
- Headings: parsed from Markdown and HTML heading structure.
- Links: indexed from Markdown link forms and HTML anchor tags.
- Lists: indexed from Markdown list block starts and HTML `ul`/`ol` tags.
- List items: indexed from Markdown list markers and HTML `<li>` tags.
- Tables: indexed from Markdown table starts and HTML `<table>` tags.
- Block quotes: indexed from Markdown quote starts and HTML `<blockquote>` tags.
- Code blocks: indexed from Markdown fenced code boundaries and HTML `<pre>`/`<code>` tags.
- Bookmarks: indexed from active bookmark positions.
- Paragraph anchors: blank-line paragraph boundaries for text/Markdown; block-level HTML tags (`p`, `li`, `blockquote`, `pre`, `h1` to `h6`, `td`, `th`) for HTML.
- Sentence anchors: sentence-ending punctuation boundaries.

Performance and invalidation:

- Quick Nav movement reuses cached anchors to avoid reparsing per keystroke.
- Index invalidates when document text changes, when full-text replacement occurs, and when active tab changes.
- Missing-target announcements are plain-language and surface-aware (for example, "No list items found in this HTML document").

Customization:

- Settings include wrap behavior for Quick Nav boundary traversal, feedback mode (`speech`, `sound`, `both`, `none`), and move-announcement detail (`browse_mode_move_detail`: `position`, `line`, `none`) — the latter controls whether a completed move reports line and column, line only, or nothing. Heading and block movement announce through the same path and setting as every other Quick Nav element type.
- Keyboard manager can reassign Quick Nav actions and leader sequences.

### 5.3 File operations

- `Ctrl+N` new blank document.
- `Ctrl+O` open via the user-selected dialog. When **Settings > General > Use simple file open dialog** is on, QUILL shows a keyboard-friendly picker (issue #620) with a path field, a small file-type filter, a recent-locations list, a hidden-files toggle, and a `Use Windows Dialog` button that opens the standard picker for one invocation. When the setting is off, QUILL shows the standard `wx.FileDialog` directly. The setting is off by default; the simple dialog is opt-in. The full supported list is in [section 5.3a](#53a-extended-format-support). The headline groups are:
  - **Plain text and config**: `txt`, `log`, `cue`, `ini`, `json`, `jsonc`, `json5`, `xml`, `csv`, `tsv`, `yaml`, `yml`, `toml`, `nfo`, `env`, `properties`, `conf`, `cfg`, `dotenv`.

- `Ctrl+Shift+S` opens Save As directly.
- Recent files: last N (default 10, range 5 to 50). If empty, announce "No recent files."
- File Explorer integration: settings panel lets the user register Quill with Windows for chosen extensions and add an "Open with Quill" verb.

### 5.3a Extended format support

The table below lists every format family Quill adds, why each matters, and how Quill renders it. Every renderer follows the same rules: present text in a standard edit field, preserve the original file, escalate to the enhanced extractor or AI repair only when local extraction is poor and the user asks.

| Format family | Specific formats added | Why it matters | How Quill renders it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spreadsheets** | `xlsx`, `xlsm`, `xls`, `ods`, `numbers`, `csv`, `tsv` | Blind users routinely receive spreadsheet attachments; current accessible tooling forces Excel | Each sheet becomes a section. Tables are emitted as accessible plain-text columns with header row, `Ctrl+Shift+Right/Left` navigates by column, `Ctrl+Shift+Down` summarises totals |
| **OpenDocument** | `odt`, `odp`, `odg`, `ods` | Common in EU public sector and academia | Direct extractor via `odfpy`; structure preserved as headings, lists, tables |
| **Apple iWork** | `pages`, `key`, `numbers` | Cross-platform collaboration is increasingly common; iWork files arrive in email frequently | Local extractor via the iWork archive format; AI escalation for complex layouts |
| **Legacy office** | `ppt`, `xls`, `wpd`, `wps`, `wri`, `sxw`/`sxc`/`sxi` | Older institutional archives still circulate | Best-effort local readers; AI escalation by sending the original file when local reading fails |
| **E-books (proprietary)** | `azw`, `azw3`, `mobi`, `kfx`, `fb2`, `lit`, `lrf`, `prc`, `pdb`, `tcr` | EPUB-only support excludes most Kindle and older e-book libraries | Reuse Calibre's conversion engine where present (plugin in v1.1) or bundled minimal readers for the open formats |
| **Comics with text** | `cbz`, `cbr` | Educational comics and graphic textbooks ship in CBZ | Extract pages, OCR each, present per-page text with page navigation |
| **DjVu and XPS** | `djvu`, `xps`, `oxps` | Academic scans (DjVu) and Microsoft alternatives to PDF (XPS) are common in research | Local extractors; PDF-style page navigation |
| **PostScript** | `ps`, `eps` | Academic preprints and older typeset documents | Convert via Ghostscript to text + page markers |
| **TeX and Typst** | `tex`, `latex`, `bib`, `bibtex`, `typ` | Academic and scientific writing community is largely TeX-based; no accessible plain editor handles it gracefully | Plain-text editing with optional rendered preview to PDF/HTML via local engines; bibtex entries readable as structured records |
| **Lightweight markup** | `rst`, `adoc`/`asciidoc`, `textile`, `org`, `wiki`/`mediawiki`, `bbcode` | Documentation toolchains for Python, Ruby, Asciidoctor, Emacs Org-mode, wikis | Plain-text editing; preview via the appropriate renderer; export to HTML/DOCX |
| **DAISY and braille** | `daisy` 2.02/3, `nimas`, `brf`, `brl`, `pef`, `ueb` | Accessible publishing standards that ironically lack accessible editors. Braille files need round-trip print/braille translation | Linear text presentation with chapter/section navigation; liblouis for braille back-translation; export to BRF |
| **MHTML and web archives** | `mhtml`/`mht`, `warc`, `wacz`, browser "single file" saves, Safari `.webarchive` | Saved web pages are the second-most common research artefact after PDF | Extract the primary document; show resources list; allow Preview as HTML |
| **SVG** | `svg` | SVG is text; titles, descriptions, and `<text>` content carry semantic meaning often inaccessible elsewhere | Show as XML in edit field plus a "Reading View" that extracts titles, descriptions, and text in document order |
| **Subtitles (full set)** | `sbv`, `ass`/`ssa`, `sub`, `ttml`/`dfxp`, `scc`, `stl`, `cap` | broadcast and YouTube captioners need the rest | Render as plain text with optional timecode column; export between formats |
| **Email and mail archives** | `eml`, `msg`, `mbox`, `pst` | Email frequently arrives as standalone files (forwarded, archived, exported); `.msg` and `.pst` are pure Microsoft and historically painful | Headers as a labelled block, body as plain text, attachments listed with "Open in Quill" actions; `pst` and `mbox` get an index UI |
| **Calendar and contacts** | `ics`, `vcf` | Common attachments; today opened by heavy apps | Render events and contacts as structured plain text records |
| **Notes ecosystems** | `one`, `enex`, Apple Notes export, `bear`, Simplenote JSON | People have years of notes locked in proprietary apps | Read-only renderers; each note opens as its own document |
| **Source code and config** | Full polyglot list in 5.3 | Programmers and sysadmins use Quill for quick edits; the screen-reader story for VS Code is good but heavyweight | Syntax-aware tokeniser informs spell check and word navigation; presentation remains plain text |
| **Build, package, IaC** | `Dockerfile`, `*.tf`, `*.bicep`, `*.k8s.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. | DevOps work is text-heavy and benefits from a calm reader | Plain text with section folding via shortcut, schema-aware error reporting in the `!` palette mode |
| **Diff and patch** | `diff`, `patch`, `gitconfig`, `gitignore` | Code review and merge work | Hunks rendered with `+`/`-` summarised aloud; `Ctrl+]` next hunk |
| **Notebooks** | `ipynb`, `qmd`, `rmd` | Data science and research; notebooks are JSON and unreadable in basic editors | Linearised: each cell becomes a section with role header ("Code cell 3", "Markdown cell 4", "Output of cell 3"), outputs included where text |
| **Data files** | `sqlite`/`db`, `parquet`, `feather` | Researchers and analysts frequently inspect data files | Read-only schema view + first N rows as a table; refuses to edit and explains why |
| **Logs and trace** | `evtx`, gzipped logs, single-file archives | Sysadmin and support workflows | Auto-extract; render with timestamp column |
| **Web feeds** | `rss`, `atom`, `opml`, `json-feed` | Accessible feed consumption | Render as a list of articles, Enter to open one |
| **Chat exports** | WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, Zoom, Otter, ChatGPT | People archive conversations and need to search them | Linearised conversation with speaker headers, timestamps optional |
| **Image OCR** | `png`, `jpg`, `tif` (multi-page), `bmp`, `webp`, `heic`, `avif`, `gif`, `jp2`, plus `djvu` and scanned PDFs | Photographed receipts, signage, scanned mail | Local Tesseract OCR by default; AI escalation for handwriting or poor scans |
| **Audio with transcript** | `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.m4a`/`.opus` paired with `.vtt`/`.srt`/`.txt` | Podcasts, lectures, interviews with transcripts | Opens the transcript; optional playback plugin syncs cursor to audio |
| **Code-block exchange** | Gist URLs, Pastebin URLs, snippet bundles | Developers share text via URLs daily | One-shot fetch + open as unsaved document |

Some renderers (notably KFX, PST, legacy proprietary office, and some iWork variants) require optional helper tools installed locally. Quill detects what is present at startup and the Open dialog only advertises formats it can actually read on this machine. The long-term design is a full Settings → Format Support page; the current beta already ships an External Tools and Format Support dialog that shows supported helpers, the capabilities they unlock, and copy-to-clipboard installation hints (never an automatic install).

#### Editable vs. read-only matrix

Not every format we open is something a user should edit. Quill is explicit about which formats round-trip in place vs. require Save As:

- **Save in place**: every plain-text and lightweight-markup format, source code, configs, subtitles, braille (BRF), SVG, JSON/XML/YAML/TOML, notebooks (when the user has explicitly chosen to keep notebook structure on save), and the two rich formats QUILL genuinely writes — **DOCX and RTF** — which round-trip through the canonical buffer and are re-serialized on every save (see 5.3a.1.1a).
- **Save As only (originals protected)**: DOC, PPTX/PPT, XLSX/XLS, ODT/ODP/ODS, Pages/Keynote/Numbers, PDF, PS/EPS, XPS, EPUB and other e-books, DjVu, comics, MHTML and web archives, email (`eml`, `msg`, `pst`, `mbox`), calendar and contact files, OneNote, data files (`sqlite`, `parquet`, `feather`), all image formats. Enforced at the io layer by `EXPORT_ONLY_SUFFIXES` + `UnsupportedSaveFormatError` (5.3a.1.1a), not just by UI convention.
- **Read-only with explicit refusal-to-edit message**: PST archives, parquet/feather, evtx, AZW3/KFX, anything DRM-protected.

#### Plugin escalation

Where bundling a large dependency would balloon installer size (Calibre, Ghostscript, Tesseract trained-data packs, MeCab for Japanese, LibreOffice headless for legacy office), Quill ships a thin shim and offers a one-click plugin install from the Format Support page. Plugins announce their license clearly before installing.

#### 5.3a.1 Pandoc Import / Export and Batch Conversion (issue #262)

QUILL ships a curated Tier-1 list of Pandoc-supported formats in the File menu and a four-page batch conversion wizard under Tools. The list is curated rather than exhaustive because not every Pandoc format is a good fit for a screen-reader-first editor; the menu and the wizard show only formats that meet the bar.

**Tier-1 inputs:** Markdown, CommonMark, GitHub-Flavored Markdown, HTML, Word documents (`.docx`), OpenDocument Text (`.odt`), Rich Text (`.rtf`), plain text, CSV / TSV tables, EPUB books, LaTeX / TeX.

**Tier-1 outputs:** the same set plus PDF (export only).

**Non-Pandoc export — DAISY talking book (#251):** **File > Export > DAISY Talking Book** writes a DAISY 2.02 text-only talking book. This export does not go through Pandoc; the wx-free, strict-typed `quill/io/daisy.py` (`write_daisy_textonly`) renders the live buffer directly. Because a DAISY book is a folder rather than a single file, the chosen name becomes a folder holding `ncc.html` (Navigation Control Center: `dc:`/`ncc:` metadata, `multimediaType=textNCX`, and heading links), `content.html` (XHTML 1.0 with an `id` on every readable element), and `book.smil` (SMIL 1.0 reading-order container with zero-duration `<par>`s, since the book carries no audio). Headings become player navigation points; a document with no `h1` gets a synthetic title heading so navigation is well-formed. The output opens in DAISY software readers and hardware players (Victor Reader Stream, Plextalk, APH units) and in APH Book Wizard Producer for adding TTS audio.

##### 5.3a.1.1 Single-file Import / Export

**File > Import > <format>** converts a single file from disk into a new Markdown buffer in a new tab. **File > Export > <format>** converts the current buffer to the named format on a background thread. Both routes use Pandoc and `quill.stability.safe_subprocess.run_subprocess_safely` so a misbehaving Pandoc cannot take QUILL down.

Post-conversion prompt rule (issue #262): when the target format is editable in QUILL (Markdown, CommonMark, GFM, HTML, plain text, CSV / TSV) the editor asks whether to open the new file in a new window. PDF, DOCX, EPUB, ODT, and RTF do not prompt; the file path is on the clipboard for pasting into File Explorer.

##### 5.3a.1.1a Save As conversion pipeline and format truthfulness (shipped 0.9.0 Beta 1)

**Save As converts; it never just renames.** The editor's canonical text is QUILL Markdown-style markup. `quill/io/export.py::write_document_as` is the single dispatcher every save routes through, keyed by target extension: `.rtf` re-serializes through the native RTF writer, `.docx` through `write_docx_document`, `.html`/`.htm`/`.xhtml` through the standalone HTML renderer, and `.txt`/`.md`/unknown text extensions are written verbatim (#649 round-trip contract; the explicit Save As Plain Text command is the stripping path, with the Illumination options).

**The mark-saved contract (Caroline's 0.8.0 report).** Every writer in the dispatch — including both docx branches — must call `document.mark_saved(target)` on success, so the window title, the modified flag, the tab title, and the next plain Ctrl+S are truthful. The .docx writer's missing `mark_saved` produced the "Untitled [modified] after a successful save, then an empty Save As dialog" failure; regression tests pin the contract for every format.

**Line-break policy — one editor line is one paragraph, everywhere.** The editor is line-oriented (what a screen reader user hears line by line is the document's structure). The native writers already work this way (`markdown_to_rich` maps each editor line to a paragraph); every Pandoc call whose source is QUILL canonical text must therefore use `gfm+hard_line_breaks`, never bare `gfm` (where a single newline is a soft wrap that silently joins the user's lines). This applies to the docx Pandoc fallback and to every File > Export format. Convert File / Batch Conversion of arbitrary on-disk files keep their detected source semantics.

**Export-only extension guard (data-loss invariant).** `EXPORT_ONLY_SUFFIXES` (`.pdf .doc .odt .epub .pages .ppt .pptx .xls .xlsx .sqlite .db`) marks formats QUILL can open (as extracted text) but cannot write. `write_document_as` raises `UnsupportedSaveFormatError` for them: Ctrl+S on an opened PDF/EPUB/spreadsheet must never overwrite the binary original with text (the UI explains and routes to Save As), and a typed `notes.pdf` in Save As must never mint a Markdown file wearing a `.pdf` name (the UI offers the Pandoc Export hand-off for `.pdf`/`.odt`/`.epub` and refuses the rest). This implements the "Save As only (originals protected)" row of the editable-vs-read-only matrix above as an enforced io-layer invariant rather than a UI convention. `.brf`-family and unknown text extensions stay verbatim by design.

**The editing surface stays QUILL text — audibly.** After a converting Save As (.docx/.rtf/HTML) the file on disk is the converted artifact and each subsequent save re-converts; the editor does not switch to the target format. `_announce_save_as_conversion` speaks this ("Saved as report.docx, Word format. You are still editing QUILL text; each save converts it to Word.") so the model is explicit for a screen reader user. No auto-reload is offered for .docx: a reload would round-trip through a different engine (MarkItDown) and silently lose formatting just saved.

**Filename suggestion from the first line.** `first_line_as_title` (default **on**) pre-fills Save/Export dialogs for an untitled document from its first meaningful line via `quill/core/titles.py` (markup leaders stripped, Windows-invalid characters removed, 60-char cap). It only ever suggests a name for an untitled document.

**Conversion engine preferences.** Two settings expose the engine choice with speakable outcome descriptions: `docx_read_engine` (auto | markitdown | pandoc — auto is MarkItDown-first with the raw python-docx extract as last resort; the pandoc preference degrades to auto when Pandoc is missing, so a preference never fails an open) and `docx_write_engine` (auto | native | pandoc — native is the hidden-codes-preserving python-docx writer; pandoc maps structure to Word styles and drops run-level font/size/color). The Convert File dialog carries a per-operation Conversion engine choice (Auto/Pandoc/MarkItDown) whose description follows the selection; MarkItDown is honored only where it honestly applies (Office/PDF source, Markdown/plain output) and the handler asks before substituting Pandoc, never silently. Engine evidence: `docs/qa/converter-bakeoff.md` (2026-07-04) — MarkItDown and Pandoc passed the full corpus; the python-docx reader loses tables/footnotes/links (fallback only); **pydocx is rejected permanently** (cannot import on Python 3.10+, last release 2016); **mammoth is not adopted** (no current gap) with a standing decision tree: if a MarkItDown fidelity gap appears, mammoth is the candidate and would be bundled (pure-Python; frozen builds cannot pip-install at runtime), lazily imported, and offered as a third read-engine choice.

##### 5.3a.1.2 Batch Conversion wizard

**File > Import > Batch Conversion...** and **File > Export > Batch Conversion...** (or **QUILL key, B**) open a hand-rolled `wx.Dialog` modeled on `setup_wizard_pages.py`. Four pages: Introduction (with live Pandoc version probe), Folder and options (folder picker, recursive checkbox, output-layout radio, overwrite radio), Format and profile (direction radio, Tier-1 source/target lists, profile picker), Review and start (human-readable summary).

Defaults come from `Settings.import_export_recursive`, `import_export_output_layout`, `import_export_overwrite`, and the wizard-overridable `import_export_last_folder`. The wizard can override any of these per run; the Preferences dialog is the canonical place to change defaults.

The wizard's `_SummaryPage.refresh(choices)` reads the plan aloud through `_announce()` so the user hears what they are about to apply before the batch starts. Back / Next / Start / Cancel are stock `wx.Button` controls under the standard `apply_modal_ids` modal-id contract; the wizard is keyboard-first end to end and never depends on the mouse.

##### 5.3a.1.3 Batch execution

The wizard returns a `BatchRequest` carrying a `BatchPlan` dataclass. The caller submits the plan to `MainFrame._run_background_task` so the work runs on `stability.task_manager.QuillTaskManager` (a `ThreadPoolExecutor` wrapper) instead of the UI thread. Progress is reported through the Status Page (`Help > Status Page > Tasks & Downloads`) with one live `(Task, Status, Progress, Started, Finished)` row per file. The worker honours a `threading.Event` cancel between files and raises `PandocCancelledError` if cancellation fires mid-run.

Output naming follows the issue #262 rule verbatim: keep the originating stem, replace the extension. With `output_layout="subfolder"` (the default) the output lands in an `Output/` subfolder created lazily per file; with `output_layout="same_folder"` the output lands next to the source. The three-way overwrite policy — `ask`, `never`, `always` — is enforced both at the batch level (one prompt per batch for the `ask` policy) and per file (skip on `never`, overwrite on `always`).

##### 5.3a.1.4 Conversion profiles

Seven built-in conversion profiles ship in this release (`quill.core.convert_profiles`):

- **Clean Word Document** — `--standalone` plus aggressive header/footer stripping.
- **Accessible HTML Page** — `--standalone` with `title-block` and `lang` metadata.
- **EPUB Book** — `--standalone --toc` plus the EPUB-3 metadata block.
- **GitHub README** — GitHub-Flavored Markdown with no wrapper.
- **Print PDF** — `--pdf-engine=<default>` plus the standard PDF metadata.
- **Instructor Handout** — `--standalone` with `geometry: margin=1in` and a top-level numbered section structure.
- **Plain Text for Screen Readers** — plain text with no HTML wrapper, no smart quotes, fixed 80-column width.

Each profile is a `ConvertProfile` dataclass holding its CLI flags and a plain-language description. The wizard's profile picker reads each profile aloud so the screen reader can announce what is being applied before the batch starts.

##### 5.3a.1.5 Completion announcement

When the batch finishes, `_announce()` is called with the completion line:

> "Batch conversion complete. <converted> of <total> files converted in <duration> seconds. <skipped> skipped. <failed> failed."

The line routes through the existing `announce()` -> `_announce()` -> `AnnouncementEngine` path, which already honours `announcement_backend` and `verbosity_speech_enabled`. The Status Page row updates regardless of the user's verbosity setting so sighted and low-vision users see the same result.

A short report dialog lists every file that produced warnings or failed, with the exact error string. Successful files do not appear in the report, so the dialog stays small and quick to read.

##### 5.3a.1.6 Settings

Three new `SettingSpec` entries appear in **Preferences > Editing** (issue #262):

- `import_export_recursive` — boolean, default `True`. Label: "Include subfolders in batch conversion".
- `import_export_overwrite` — choice, default `("ask", "Ask each time")`. Choices: `ask`, `never`, `always`. Label: "Overwrite behaviour for batch conversion".
- `import_export_output_layout` — choice, default `("subfolder", "Output subfolder per source folder")`. Choices: `subfolder`, `same_folder`. Label: "Default output layout for batch conversion".

A fourth field, `import_export_last_folder` (string, default `""`), is intentionally not exposed in Preferences. The wizard writes it when it starts a batch so the next run lands the user where they left off. All four fields are validated in `Settings.from_dict` against the issue #262 value sets.

##### 5.3a.1.7 Key binding

**QUILL key, B** opens the Batch Conversion wizard. The chord was added to `quill.core.keymap` and is wired through `MainFrame._on_quill_key_b`. The `B` key was chosen because it does not collide with any existing QUILL-key second-key in `main_frame_quill_key.py`.

##### 5.3a.1.8 Out of scope for this release

- **PDF import.** Pandoc cannot do it reliably; the dedicated braille and DAISY pipelines remain the right tools.
- **Tier 2 / Tier 3 formats.** A future release will replace the **Tools > Pandoc Conversion Center...** placeholder with the full format picker.
- **MarkItDown integration.** Tracked as a follow-up issue. The integration belongs in a Quillin so its dependencies stay out of the core.
- **Dedicated per-verb token for batch completion.** The verbosity system has shipped (engine, UI, runtime modes, anti-spam — see §5.91.4), and the batch-conversion completion announcement already routes through it (`MainFrame._announce` → `VerbosityController.process()`), today as the `_legacy` passthrough. Binding it to the existing `system.operation_complete` verb with a custom token template is optional polish, not done for this release.

Cross-links: this section is referenced from `### 5.25b Watch Folder automation` (the Watch Folder Quillin can use the same `BatchPlan` shape when it needs batch-style conversion) and from `§22 Startup Wizard` (the Startup wizard's "What kind of writing do you do?" intent picker exposes the Import / Export and Batch Conversion entries only when the chosen profile warrants them).

### 5.3b Microsoft Word document support (DOCX / DOC)

This section is the canonical, scoped statement of what Quill 1.0 does with Microsoft Word files (.docx and .doc). Anything not listed here is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog.

#### 5.3b.1 Complexity and Risk Context

Microsoft Word documents (.docx = XML-based, .doc = binary OLE2 format) present genuine complexity risks:

1. **Formatting metadata**: fonts, sizes, colors, styles, themes, templates
2. **Complex structure**: headers, footers, text boxes, shapes, comments, tracked changes
3. **Media embedding**: images, charts, SmartArt, embedded objects, videos
4. **Advanced features**: fields, macros (VBA), content controls, form controls, ActiveX
5. **Reading order challenges**: columns, text boxes in non-linear positions, floating shapes
6. **Legacy cruft**: corrupted documents, OLE objects, mixed encodings, malformed XML

Quill's design principle ("The edit field is sacred") prevents visual formatting preservation in v1.0. Word files must be extracted to plain, linear text in `wx.TextCtrl` for guaranteed screen-reader compatibility with NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator.

#### 5.3b.2 Supported Features (What Gets Extracted)

**Core content (via Pandoc extraction):**

- ✅ Body text and paragraphs
- ✅ Headings (levels 1–6) → rendered as Markdown `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.
- ✅ Bullet and numbered lists (nested up to 3 levels)
- ✅ Hyperlinks → preserved as plain-text URLs or Markdown links
- ✅ Comments and tracked changes → extracted as plain text with attributions
- ✅ Footnotes and endnotes → appended as footnote text
- ✅ Tables → converted to plain-text table representation (Markdown or ASCII)
- ✅ Page breaks → rendered as visual markers `--- Page Break ---`
- ✅ Basic structural integrity: proper paragraph separation, list context

**Conversion support (via Pandoc bridge):**

- ✅ Word → Markdown (for universal editing)
- ✅ Word → HTML (for preview/export)
- ✅ Word → Plain text
- ✅ Word → RTF (via Pandoc if needed)
- ✅ Cross-format roundtrip: Markdown ↔ Word, HTML ↔ Word

**Metadata (stored in `Document.source_metadata`):**

- ✅ Document title, author, subject
- ✅ Creation/modification dates
- ✅ Word count, page count (if available)
- ✅ Character encoding detection and preservation
- ✅ Extraction engine name and version (Pandoc 3.1+)
- ✅ Quality score (0–100) quantifying extraction fidelity

#### 5.3b.3 Unsupported Features (Not Extracted, User Warned)

**Formatting (intentionally dropped for v1.0 compatibility):**

- ❌ Font names, sizes, colors, bold/italic/underline
- ❌ Paragraph alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- ❌ Line spacing, paragraph spacing, indentation
- ❌ Themes, master pages, custom styles
- ❌ Watermarks, page backgrounds

**Advanced structures (extracted with limitations or skipped):**

- ⚠️ **Images**: Filenames and captions only; image content is NOT OCR'd unless user opts in v1.1+
- ⚠️ **Charts**: Extracted as text labels only; visual data is lost
- ⚠️ **Text boxes and shapes**: Attempted extraction; may appear out of order or be skipped
- ⚠️ **Headers and footers**: Extracted, appended as a section at end of document
- ⚠️ **Columns**: Flattened to single column; reading order may be unpredictable

**Security-sensitive (explicitly blocked or sanitized):**

- ❌ **VBA macros**: Silently ignored; Pandoc subprocess does not execute any code
- ❌ Embedded executables or ActiveX controls
- ❌ External links to remote templates or resources (not followed)
- ❌ OLE embedded objects (attempted extraction of embedded text only)

**Deferred to v1.1+ (not attempted in v1.0):**

- ❌ Revision history or multi-user collaboration metadata
- ❌ Form fields and fillable controls
- ❌ Custom numbering or multi-level list hacks
- ❌ Mail merge fields
- ❌ Document protection or permissions (file access checked by OS only)

#### 5.3b.4 Architecture: I/O Module Design

**New module: `quill/io/word.py`**

- `read_word_document(path, timeout_sec=60.0, fallback_to_plaintext=True) → Document`
  - Extracts text from .docx or .doc file
  - Returns `Document` with extracted text, metadata, quality_score, and warnings
  - Timeout protection: max 60 seconds to prevent runaway conversions
  - Error cascade on failure: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext fallback
  - Raises `UnsupportedFormatError` or `ExtractionTimeoutError` on fatal errors

- `write_word_document_safe(document, path=None, format="docx", warn_on_formatting_loss=True) → Path`
  - Safely writes extracted text back to Word format
  - Shows warning dialog: "Saving as plain text. Original Word formatting will be lost."
  - Uses Pandoc (Markdown → .docx) for clean roundtrip
  - Never overwrites original without explicit user confirmation

- `convert_word_to_markdown(path) → str`
  - Converts Word document to GitHub-flavored Markdown
  - Uses Pandoc with specific output flags for best compatibility

**Enhanced module: `quill/io/pandoc.py`**

Add Word-specific conversion routes:

```python
READER_MAP: dict[str, str] = {
    "docx": "docx",  # NEW: from .docx
    "doc": "doc",  # NEW: from .doc (legacy)
}

WRITER_MAP: dict[str, str] = {
    "word": "docx",  # NEW: export to .docx
    "word-old": "doc",  # NEW: export to .doc (legacy)
}


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class WordMetadata:
    title: str | None
    author: str | None
    subject: str | None
    created: str | None
    modified: str | None
    word_count: int
    page_count: int
```

**Updated module: `quill/io/detect.py`**

```python
TEXT_EXTENSIONS = {
    # ... existing ...
    ".docx",  # NEW
    ".doc",  # NEW
}


def looks_like_word_document(path: Path) -> bool:
    return path.suffix.lower() in {".docx", ".doc"}
```

#### 5.3b.5 Error Handling: Graceful Cascade

Word extraction implements a three-tier fallback strategy to ensure the app never crashes on corrupted, malicious, or malformed files:

**Tier 1: Pandoc (primary path)**

- Subprocess-isolated extraction via Pandoc 3.1+
- Timeout: 60 seconds (hard limit)
- Success: `quality_score ≥ 60`
- On failure → Tier 2

**Tier 2: python-docx (fallback)**

- Basic paragraph/heading extraction only
- No Pandoc dependency required
- `quality_score ~40` (limited feature set)
- Errors logged; user sees warning banner
- On failure → Tier 3

**Tier 3: Emergency UTF-8 read**

- Last-resort: read file as text
- Returns garbled but won't crash
- `quality_score 0`
- Clear error message: "Document could not be fully read. Try opening in Microsoft Word first."

#### 5.3b.6 User-Facing Messaging (Document Intake Report)

When opening a .docx or .doc file, Quill displays an in-app banner (stored in `source_metadata`, displayed by `main_frame.py`):

```text
📄 Word Document Opened
This document has been converted to plain text for editing in Quill.
• Formatting (fonts, colors, styles) has been removed.
• Tables and lists have been simplified for readability.
• Images and charts have been replaced with captions only.
• If you need the original formatting, open this file in Microsoft Word.

Original file: Z:\documents\report.docx
Engine: Pandoc 3.1.0 | Quality score: 85/100

[🔄 Retry extraction]  [💾 Save as .txt]  [📖 Show details]
```

The banner is concise and accessible: each item is announced separately via screen reader, and action buttons are navigable via Tab.

**Where Am I enhancement:** When cursor is at the start of an extracted Word document, `Ctrl+Alt+W` (Where Am I) announces:
> "Word document. Title: Q2 Report. Author: Jane Doe. 8 pages, 2,451 words. Extracted by Pandoc 3.1.0. Quality: 85 out of 100. Formatting not preserved."

#### 5.3b.7 Pandoc Integration and Format Bridge

Pandoc is a universal document converter supporting 30+ input and output formats. Full integration enables:

**Phase 1 (v1.0 — this release):**

- Pandoc reads .docx and .doc files
- Export to Markdown, HTML, RTF via `File > Save As`
- Metadata extraction for document properties
- Fallback pipeline: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext

**Phase 2 (v1.1):**

- Pandoc template engine for styled exports
- Batch conversion: `Tools > Convert Document`
- Support for .odt (LibreOffice), .tex (LaTeX)
- Optional: OCR images in Word documents (cloud service or local Tesseract)

**Phase 3 (v1.2+):**

- Pandoc filters for custom transformations
- Plugin API for format extension

**Installation and resource limits:**

- Pandoc is bundled with Quill on Windows (or installed via `choco install pandoc`)
- Subprocess isolation: Pandoc runs out-of-process; malicious code cannot harm Quill
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per document (hard limit)
- **Memory**: Monitored via `psutil`; warns if > 500 MB used during extraction
- **File size**: Pre-check before extraction; if > 100 MB, warn and offer async extraction

#### 5.3b.8 Editable Rendering, Protected Original

Word files follow Quill's principle: **originals are read-only by default**.

- The extracted text is presented in the standard multi-line editor
- `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so the original `.docx` / `.doc` cannot be overwritten
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` opens Save As directly
- Save dialog offers: `.txt`, `.md` (Markdown), `.html`, `.docx` (new Word), or All Files
- Before saving to `.docx`, a warning dialog appears:
  > "Saving as plain text. Original Word formatting will be lost. Continue?"

#### 5.3b.9 Metadata and Quality Scoring

Extracted metadata is stored in the `Document.source_metadata` dict:

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "word",
    "format": "docx",  # or "doc"
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "engine_version": "3.1.0",
    "quality_score": 85,  # 0–100
    "extraction_warnings": [
        "Images not extracted (captions only)",
        "Tracked changes simplified to plain text",
        "Columns flattened to single column",
    ],
    "word_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Report",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Financial Review",
        "created": "2026-03-15T10:30:00Z",
        "modified": "2026-05-28T14:22:00Z",
        "word_count": 2451,
        "page_count": 8,
    },
}
```

**Quality score calculation (0–100):**

- Start at 100
- Subtract 5 per non-extracted image
- Subtract 10 per text box with suspected out-of-order content
- Subtract 15 if complex shapes or columns detected
- Subtract 20 if corrupted sections skipped
- Floor at 0, never negative

#### 5.3b.10 Risk Mitigation and Safety

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Large .docx files (10+ MB) cause extraction to hang | Application freeze, loss of edits to other docs | 60-second Pandoc timeout, async extraction option for large files |
| Corrupted Word files crash parser | Application crash | Graceful error cascade: Pandoc → python-docx → plaintext; never crash |
| Complex formatting confuses extraction order | User sees garbled text | Clear in-app banner: "Word formatting not preserved" + retry option |
| VBA macros or malicious code in .docx | Security vulnerability | Pandoc subprocess isolation; no code execution; explicit security testing |
| .doc (OLE) files fail silently | Silent data loss | Pandoc attempts .doc → XML; if it fails, fallback to python-docx |
| User saves edits back to .docx, loses formatting | Data loss if user relies on styles | Always prompt before save: "Saving as plain text. Continue?" + option to cancel |
| Memory explosion from embedded media | Out-of-memory crash | Pre-check file size; if > 50 MB, warn; if > 100 MB, offer async extraction |

#### 5.3b.10a Extraction Quality Diagnostics

Quill applies accessibility-aware diagnostic techniques to deeply analyze Word documents and produce actionable extraction warnings:

**Paragraph-level diagnostics:**

- **Fake lists detection**: Scan paragraphs for manually typed bullet characters (•, ‣, ◯, ◯, ◦, ⁃) or numbered patterns ("1.", "a)") instead of built-in list styles; flag as "Potential fake list" in `source_metadata`
- **All-caps content**: Detect paragraphs in ALL CAPS (not formatting, but typed caps); if > 3 words, flag as potential heading that should be restyles
- **Long sections without headings**: If > 20 paragraphs appear without a heading, flag as "Consider adding structure" in extraction warnings
- **Repeated spaces for layout**: Detect runs of 3+ consecutive spaces used for visual alignment (e.g., `Qty: ___Price:___`); flag as "Document uses spaces for layout, which may reflow unexpectedly in Quill"
- **Repeated font families in paragraph**: Track non-Arial fonts per paragraph; cap reporting at 3 example locations + summary count to avoid spam

**Document-level diagnostics:**

- **Title and language metadata**: Extract document properties (title, language, author); if missing, flag "Document title not set in properties" as info-level warning
- **Page setup**: Extract margin configuration; compare against expected values; if margins are unusual (< 0.5" or > 1.5"), note in warnings
- **Hyphenation**: Detect if auto-hyphenation is enabled; flag as "Hyphenation may break words unexpectedly when text reflows"
- **Heading hierarchy**: Scan for missing levels (e.g., H1 followed by H3) or skipped levels; flag as structural issue

**Extraction engine diagnostics:**

- **Track extraction path**: Note which engine extracted each paragraph (Pandoc, python-docx, plaintext)
- **Per-paragraph confidence**: If Pandoc succeeded but python-docx fallback was triggered for some content, track which paragraphs used fallback
- **Engine switch detection**: If Pandoc extracted pages 1–8 but python-docx took pages 9–12, surface this as "Extraction method changed mid-document" warning

**Example source_metadata structure with accessibility-aware diagnostics:**

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "word",
    "format": "docx",
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "engine_version": "3.1.0",
    "quality_score": 78,  # Reduced from 85 due to diagnostics
    # accessibility-aware diagnostics
    "extraction_diagnostics": {
        "fake_lists_detected": 2,  # Manually typed bullets
        "all_caps_paragraphs": 1,  # Heading-like caps text
        "long_sections_without_headings": ["Pages 5-6 (23 paragraphs)"],
        "repeated_space_paragraphs": 3,  # Layout abuse detected
        "non_arial_fonts": {"Times New Roman": 5, "Courier": 2},
        "hyphenation_enabled": True,
        "heading_hierarchy_issues": ["H1 at page 1, then H3 at page 2"],
        "extraction_engine_switches": ["Pandoc pages 1-8, python-docx pages 9-10"],
    },
    "extraction_warnings": [
        {

            "location": "Paragraph 5, Paragraph 12",
            "user_action": "review",
            "suggestion": "Consider reformatting as proper lists in Word",
        },
        {
            "id": "LONG_SECTION_NO_HEADING",
            "severity": "info",
            "message": "23 paragraphs without a heading (pages 5-6)",
            "location": "Paragraphs 45-68",
            "user_action": "review",
            "suggestion": "Add section heading for readability",
        },
        {
            "id": "HYPHENATION_ENABLED",
            "severity": "warning",
            "message": "Automatic hyphenation is enabled; hyphenated words may reflow unexpectedly in Quill",
            "location": "Document Settings",
            "user_action": "accept",
            "suggestion": "Consider disabling hyphenation in Word for cleaner reflow",
        },
    ],
    "word_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Report",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Financial Review",
        "created": "2026-03-15T10:30:00Z",
        "modified": "2026-05-28T14:22:00Z",
        "word_count": 2451,
        "page_count": 8,
        "language": "en-US",
        "margins": {
            "top_in": 1.0,
            "bottom_in": 1.0,
            "left_in": 1.0,
            "right_in": 1.0,
        },
    },
}
```

**User experience enhancement:**

Instead of a flat banner, Quill displays diagnostics with context:

```text
📄 Word Document Opened
Extracted via Pandoc 3.1.0 | Quality: 78/100 (down from 85 due to structural issues)

✓ 8 pages extracted, 2,451 words
✓ 12 headings (H1-H3) converted
⚠ 2 paragraphs with typed bullet characters (should be proper lists)
⚠ Long section without headings (23 paragraphs on pages 5-6)
⚠ Hyphenation enabled (may cause unexpected line breaks)
ℹ Document title: "Q2 Report" | Language: en-US

[🔍 View diagnostics] [💾 Save as .txt] [Learn more]
```

Clicking `[🔍 View diagnostics]` opens a detailed panel showing each diagnostic with suggestions and locations.

#### 5.3b.11 Testing Strategy

**Test corpus (stored in `tests/fixtures/word/`):**

| Document | Scenario |
|----------|----------|
| `simple_heading.docx` | Single heading + paragraph, minimal structure |
| `multi_page_structured.docx` | 5 pages, multiple headings (H1–H3), numbered + bulleted lists, tables |
| `embedded_images.docx` | 3 images with alt text; verify alt text extracted, images are not |
| `tracked_changes.docx` | Paragraph with deletions/insertions marked; verify resolved to plain text |
| `corrupted.docx` | Intentionally malformed XML; verify graceful fallback |
| `legacy_format.doc` | MS Word 97–2003 format; verify .doc reader works |
| `password_protected.docx` | Password-protected; verify clear error message |
| `large_50mb.docx` (stub) | Verify timeout protection and progress indication |
| `malicious_macros.docx` | Contains VBA code; verify Pandoc does NOT execute, code is dropped |
| `mixed_language.docx` | Chinese, Arabic, emoji; verify encoding preserved |

**Unit tests (`tests/unit/io/test_word.py`):**

```python
def test_read_docx_simple():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/simple_heading.docx"))
    assert "Heading" in doc.text
    assert doc.source_metadata["quality_score"] > 80


def test_read_doc_legacy_format():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/legacy_format.doc"))
    assert doc.text.strip()  # Non-empty
    assert "engine" in doc.source_metadata


def test_read_corrupted_falls_back():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/corrupted.docx"))
    assert doc.source_metadata.get("quality_score", 0) < 50
    assert len(doc.text) > 0  # No crash; degraded gracefully


def test_read_timeout_protection():
    with pytest.raises(ExtractionTimeoutError):
        read_word_document(
            Path("tests/fixtures/word/large_50mb.docx"),
            timeout_sec=0.1,
        )


def test_macros_not_executed():
    doc = read_word_document(Path("tests/fixtures/word/malicious_macros.docx"))
    assert "VBA" not in doc.text and "Sub " not in doc.text
```

**Integration tests (`tests/integration/test_word_open.py`):**

- Open .docx via UI; verify text loads, no crash
- Check source_metadata banner appears
- Verify status bar shows correct word count, page count
- Save extracted text back to .docx; verify roundtrip produces sensible output
- Verify warning dialog appears before save

**Accessibility tests (`tests/a11y/test_word_screen_reader.py`):**

- NVDA/JAWS reading of extracted text
- Verify metadata banner is announced properly
- Keyboard-only workflow: open → read → navigate → save

**Performance tests (`tests/perf/test_word_extraction_speed.py`):**

- Load 5, 50, 500-page documents; measure extraction time and memory
- Confirm 60-second timeout stops runaway conversions
- Verify UI remains responsive during extraction

#### 5.3b.12 Rollout and Communication

Word documents should open through a direct/native Word-document path by default when the local engine can handle them. If that path is unavailable or fails on a particular file, Quill should offer an explicit choice to fall back to extracted-text import so the user always knows which mode they are entering.

**Pre-release (release notes):**

- Announce: "New: Microsoft Word support (v1.0)"
- Link to knowledge base: "Opening Word Documents in Quill"
- Highlight limitations: "Formatting is not preserved; use Save As for best results"

**In-app messaging (on first Word document open):**

- Display metadata banner with quality score
- Offer `[📖 Learn more]`, `[💾 Save as .txt]`, `[📝 Open as extracted text]`, `[❌ Close]` actions when the direct/native path is not available
- Help menu entry: "Opening Word Documents in Quill"

**Documentation:**

- **README**: "Supported Formats" section lists .docx/.doc with caveats
- **Knowledge base**: Step-by-step guide for opening, extracting, saving Word documents
- **Command palette**: "Open Word Document" command has full description
- **FAQ**: Proactive entries for "What happens to my formatting?" and "Can I edit the original Word file?"

#### 5.3b.13 Success Criteria

By end of v1.0:

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open .docx/.doc through a direct/native Word path when available; extracted text remains readable/navigable with screen readers as a fallback, content (headings, lists, tables, links) preserved accurately, save to .txt/Markdown/new .docx
2. ✅ **Safe**: No crashes on corrupted/malicious/large files, VBA not executed, timeout prevents runaway conversions, user warned before formatting loss
3. ✅ **Discoverable**: File > Open shows .docx/.doc as supported, File > Save As offers Word formats, in-app banner explains changes, help docs explain workflow
4. ✅ **Tested**: 10+ real-world documents tested, unit/integration/a11y/perf tests passing, no regressions in existing formats
5. ✅ **Documented**: User docs explain what is and is not supported, known limitations transparent, troubleshooting guide provided

#### 5.3b.14 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

- **Async extraction**: Large files extract in background without blocking UI
- **OCR images**: Option to OCR images in Word documents (local Tesseract or cloud service)
- **Format bridge UI**: Visual flow chart of all supported conversions (Word native/direct ↔ Markdown ↔ HTML ↔ PDF)
- **Batch conversion**: "Convert 50 Word docs to Markdown" automation
- **Metadata editor**: Simple UI to edit document title, author, creation date
- **Plugin API**: Allow plugins to register custom Word extraction filters
- **Roundtrip fidelity**: Preserve more metadata on Word → edit → Word cycles
- **Document audit mode (v1.1+)**: Scan incoming Word docs for structural issues (fake lists, poor heading hierarchy, orphaned paragraphs) and warn user
- **MarkItDown fallback**: If available, use Microsoft's MarkItDown for improved .doc and .docx extraction before Pandoc
- **VML namespace awareness**: Enhanced python-docx fallback with VML shape and text-box extraction for legacy .doc files
- **Paragraph-level diagnostics**: Track which extraction engine handled each paragraph, surface problematic content for review
- **Styled template export**: When saving as .docx, offer ACB-style or custom templates for accessibility compliance

### 5.3c Microsoft PowerPoint document support (PPTX / PPT)

This section is the canonical specification for PowerPoint support in Quill 1.0. Anything not listed is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog.

#### 5.3c.1 Complexity and Risk Context

PowerPoint presentations (.pptx = XML-based, .ppt = binary OLE2 format) present unique extraction challenges:

1. **Non-linear content**: Slides arranged by visual layout, not reading order; multiple shapes per slide
2. **Visual-first design**: Slide transitions, animations, speaker notes separate from visible content
3. **Nested structure**: Master slides, slide layouts, themes, custom templates, shapes groups
4. **Embedded media**: Images, charts, SmartArt, embedded audio/video, links
5. **Layout complexity**: Text boxes, shapes, grouped objects with reading-order dependencies
6. **Presenter-specific data**: Speaker notes, slide timings, presentation settings
7. **Legacy cruft**: .ppt binary format, corrupted presentations, mixed encoding, malformed XML

Quill prioritizes **linear text extraction and speaker notes over slide visual preservation**. The design principle ("The edit field is sacred") prevents visual formatting preservation in v1.0.

#### 5.3c.2 Supported Features (What Gets Extracted)

**Read (Pandoc extraction):**

- ✅ Slide titles
- ✅ Body text and bullet points (nested up to 3 levels)
- ✅ Text from text boxes (best-effort reading order)
- ✅ Speaker notes (always extracted, separately indexed)
- ✅ Hyperlinks → preserved as plain-text URLs or Markdown links
- ✅ Slide numbers and slide count
- ✅ Presentation metadata: title, author, subject, creation date
- ✅ Basic slide structure: explicit slide markers for boundary detection
- ✅ Chart and SmartArt labels (text-only; visual data is lost)

**Conversion support (via Pandoc bridge):**

- ✅ PowerPoint → Markdown (slide-by-slide structure)
- ✅ PowerPoint → HTML (presentation as linear HTML document)
- ✅ PowerPoint → Plain text

**Metadata:**

- ✅ Presentation title, author, subject, keywords
- ✅ Creation/modification dates
- ✅ Slide count, speaker notes count
- ✅ Character encoding detection and preservation

#### 5.3c.3 Unsupported Features (Not Extracted, Logged, User Warned)

**Visual design (intentionally dropped for v1.0 compatibility):**

- ❌ Slide backgrounds, themes, custom templates
- ❌ Font names, sizes, colors, bold/italic/underline
- ❌ Slide transitions and animations (detected but not played)
- ❌ Master slides and slide layouts (flattened to content only)
- ❌ Alignment, positioning, spacing of text boxes
- ❌ Watermarks, headers, footers

**Advanced structures (extracted with limitations or skipped):**

- ⚠️ **Images and pictures**: Filenames and captions only; image content is NOT OCR'd unless user opts in v1.1+
- ⚠️ **Charts**: Extracted as text labels only; visual data is lost; title and data labels if readable
- ⚠️ **SmartArt**: Converted to bullet-point approximation; visual hierarchy is lost
- ⚠️ **Embedded video/audio**: NOT extracted; presence flagged with duration if available
- ⚠️ **Text boxes and shapes**: Attempted extraction; may appear out of slide reading order
- ⚠️ **Slide layouts and masters**: Flattened to content only; layout structure is not preserved
- ⚠️ **Animations and timing**: Detected and reported but not executed; all animated content extracted

**Security-sensitive (explicitly blocked or sanitized):**

- ❌ Embedded ActiveX controls or macros (VBA) — silently ignored; Pandoc does not execute
- ❌ External links to remote templates or resources (not followed)
- ❌ OLE embedded objects

**Deferred to v1.1+ (not attempted in v1.0):**

- ❌ Presentation handout mode or notes pages export
- ❌ Custom animations or presentation sequences (click-through, auto-play)
- ❌ Form controls or interactive content
- ❌ Presenter view or presenter notes as a separate stream

#### 5.3c.4 Slide Linearization with Reading-Order Detection
PowerPoint is inherently non-linear. Quill converts to linear text with intelligent, accessibility-aware reading-order analysis:

Screen readers follow the XML tree order of shapes, not the visual layout. When these don't match, screen readers read slides in the wrong order. Quill analyzes both orders and extracts in visual order (what user sees) while flagging reading-order mismatches to the user.

**Output: Intelligent slide extraction with reading-order diagnostics**

```text
--- Slide 2: Agenda ---
[Title appears first - reading order verified]
Agenda

[3 text boxes detected on slide; visual order verified]
Left column (top-left position):
  • Introduction
    • Background
    • Scope

Right column (top-right position):
  • Main topics
    • Topic 1
    • Topic 2

Center callout (center position):
  🔹 All topics are in scope

📊 Reading Order Analysis:
  ✓ Visual order matches XML order (correct for screen readers)
  ✓ Title reads first (best practice)
  Shapes in reading order: Title → Left → Right → Center
```

#### 5.3c.5 Smart Speaker Notes Extraction
Speaker notes are **always extracted and separately indexed** with intelligent metadata:

- Presence detection: slide has/lacks notes
- Timing hints: notes mentioning "2 minutes", "pause here", "auto-advance"
- Visual references: notes mentioning images, charts, diagrams on the slide
- Presenter guidance: transitions, animation, pacing guidance

Example metadata:

```python
{
    "slide": 5,
    "slide_title": "Results",
    "notes": "Reference the chart. This slide auto-advances in 5 seconds.",
    "notes_has_timing": True,
    "notes_mentions_visuals": True,
    "notes_word_count": 18,
}
```

**Magical UI integration:** When user navigates to a slide with speaker notes, Quill announces:

> "Slide 5 of 15: Results. Speaker notes mention slide visuals and timing. Notes say: 'Reference the chart. This slide auto-advances in 5 seconds.'"

#### 5.3c.6 Animations and Timing Detection with WCAG Analysis
Animations are **detected, categorized, and intelligently reported** using WCAG timing analysis:

- Slide-level auto-advance timing (WCAG 2.2.1): < 3 seconds flagged as violation
- Shape-level animations: entrance, exit, click-triggered animations categorized
- Animation impact: content appearing on click is flagged as potentially hidden

Example output:

```text
⏱ Animation Timing Analysis:
  • Title: "Fade in" (0.5s, starts with slide)
  • Content: "Fly in" (1.0s, appears on click)

🎯 Accessibility Notes:
  → Title auto-animates, so screen reader reads immediately
  → Content requires manual click to reveal
  → Quill has extracted ALL text; no content lost
  ⚠ Warning: Slide 3 auto-advances in 2.5s (< 3s WCAG recommendation)
```

#### 5.3c.7 Slide Title Analysis
Duplicate or missing slide titles break outline navigation. Quill analyzes titles:

- Missing titles: slide has no title shape
- Duplicate titles: same title on multiple slides
- Weak titles: titles that don't describe slide content

Example diagnostics:

```python
"extraction_diagnostics": {
    "slide_titles": [
        {"slide": 1, "title": "Title Slide", "issue": None},
        {"slide": 5, "title": "[No title]", "issue": "missing"},
        {"slide": 6, "title": "Agenda", "issue": "duplicate", "also_on_slides": [2]},
    ],
}
```

#### 5.3c.8 Link and Alt-Text Quality Analysis
Quill checks for accessibility patterns in hyperlinks and alt text:

- **Bad link text**: "click here", "here", "link", "more"
- **Bare URLs**: raw URLs used as link text instead of descriptive text
- **Missing alt text**: images and charts without descriptions
- **Filename alt text**: alt text that's just the image filename (unhelpful)

#### 5.3c.9 Chart and Visual Content Analysis
Quill detects charts, SmartArt, and images. For charts:

- Extracts chart type (column, line, pie, etc.)
- Extracts chart title and axis labels from XML
- Checks for alt text describing the chart
- Attempts to infer data values from label positions (with caution warnings)

#### 5.3c.10 Extraction Quality Diagnostics (Comprehensive Scoring)

Instead of simple text-density scoring, Quill implements **findings-based quality scoring**:

**Quality scoring system:**

- Baseline: 100 points
- Per-finding penalties (e.g., missing alt text: -5, auto-advance < 3s: -8, duplicate title: -3)
- Bonuses for best practices (speaker notes on >80% of slides: +2, correct reading order: +1)

Example breakdown:

```text
Quality Score: 78/100

Baseline:                                          100
-5 (Images without alt text)                        -5
-5 (Chart without alt text)                         -5
-8 (Slide 3: Auto-advance 2.5s < 3s WCAG)          -8
-3 (Duplicate title)                                -3
+1 (Reading order verified)                         +1
___________________________________________
Quality:                                            78
```

**In-app quality dashboard:**

```text
📊 PowerPoint Presentation Opened
Quality Score: 78/100

Extraction Summary:
  • 15 slides extracted
  • 12 slides have speaker notes
  • 5 animations detected
  • 8 images (5 with alt text, 3 missing)
  • 3 charts (1 with alt text, 2 missing)

⚠ Issues Found (3):
  1. Slide 3: Auto-advance too fast (2.5s < 3s) - WCAG 2.2.1
  2. Slides 2, 6: Duplicate title "Agenda"
  3. 3 images without alt text

✓ All text extracted successfully (no content lost)
```

#### 5.3c.11 User-Facing Messaging

When opening a .pptx or .ppt file, Quill displays:

```text
📊 PowerPoint Presentation Opened
This presentation has been converted to plain text for editing in Quill.
• Slide structure, formatting, and animations are not preserved.
• Text boxes and shapes have been simplified to plain text.
• Images, charts, and embedded media have been replaced with captions only.
• Speaker notes are available (12 slides have notes).
• If you need the original presentation, open this file in PowerPoint.

Original file: Z:\documents\Q2-review.pptx
Engine: Pandoc 3.1.0 | Slides: 15 | Quality score: 82/100

[📖 View notes]  [💾 Save as .txt]  [📖 Learn more]
```

**Where Am I enhancement:** When cursor is at document start, `Ctrl+Alt+W` announces:

> "PowerPoint presentation. Title: Q2 Review. 15 slides, 5,847 words. Speaker notes on 12 slides. Extracted by Pandoc 3.1.0. Quality: 82 out of 100."

#### 5.3c.12 Editable Rendering, Protected Original

Presentations follow Quill's principle: **originals are read-only by default**.

- Extracted text is presented in the standard editor
- `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so original `.pptx` cannot be overwritten
- Save dialog offers: `.txt`, `.md` (Markdown), `.html`, new `.pptx`, or All Files
- Before saving to `.pptx`, warning appears: "Saving as plain text. Original slide structure will be lost. Continue?"

#### 5.3c.13 Metadata and Extraction Diagnostics

Extracted metadata stored in `Document.source_metadata`:

```python
source_metadata = {
    "source_kind": "powerpoint",
    "format": "pptx",  # or "ppt"
    "engine": "pandoc",
    "quality_score": 82,  # 0–100 (findings-based)
    "powerpoint_metadata": {
        "title": "Q2 Review",
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "subject": "Quarterly Business Review",
        "created": "2026-02-15T10:30:00Z",
        "modified": "2026-05-28T14:22:00Z",

        ],
    },
}
```

#### 5.3c.14 Testing Strategy

**Test corpus (stored in `tests/fixtures/powerpoint/`):**

| Document | Scenario |
|----------|----------|
| `simple_title_slide.pptx` | Single slide with title and bullet points |
| `multi_slide_structured.pptx` | 10 slides with titles, nested bullets, speaker notes |
| `with_charts.pptx` | 5 slides with embedded charts; extract labels only |
| `with_images.pptx` | 3 slides with images and captions |
| `with_animations.pptx` | Slides with animations and transitions; verify all text extracted |
| `legacy_format.ppt` | MS PowerPoint 97–2003 format; verify .ppt reader works |
| `corrupted.pptx` | Intentionally malformed XML; verify graceful fallback |
| `large_100_slides.pptx` | Large presentation; verify timeout protection |

**Unit tests (`tests/unit/io/test_powerpoint.py`):**

```python
def test_read_pptx_simple():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/simple_title_slide.pptx"))
    assert "Slide 1" in doc.text
    assert doc.source_metadata["quality_score"] > 80


def test_speaker_notes_extracted():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/with_speaker_notes.pptx"))
    assert len(doc.source_metadata["speaker_notes"]) > 0


def test_animations_detected():
    doc = read_powerpoint_presentation(Path("tests/fixtures/powerpoint/with_animations.pptx"))
    assert doc.source_metadata["extraction_diagnostics"]["animations_detected"] > 0
```

#### 5.3c.15 Safety and Security

- ✅ **Sandbox execution**: Pandoc runs in subprocess
- ✅ **Resource limits**: Timeout (60s), memory monitoring
- ✅ **No code execution**: VBA macros NOT executed
- ✅ **Fallback chain**: Pandoc → python-pptx → plaintext
- ✅ **User consent**: Warning before overwriting original

#### 5.3c.16 Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open .pptx/.ppt, extract text readable with screen readers, speaker notes accessible
2. ✅ **Safe**: No crashes on corrupted/malicious files, VBA not executed, user warned before data loss
3. ✅ **Discoverable**: File > Open shows .pptx/.ppt as supported, in-app banner explains changes
4. ✅ **Tested**: 10+ real presentations tested, unit/integration/a11y tests passing
5. ✅ **Documented**: User docs explain what is and is not supported

#### 5.3c.17 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

- **Async extraction**: Large presentations extract in background without blocking UI
- **OCR images**: Option to OCR images in presentations (local Tesseract or cloud service)
- **Handout export**: Linearized slides + speaker notes as single document
- **Presentation outline navigator**: Slide titles as expandable tree with speaker notes
- **Batch conversion**: "Convert 10 presentations to Markdown"
- **Plugin API**: Allow plugins to register custom presentation extraction filters
- **MarkItDown fallback**: Use Microsoft's MarkItDown for improved extraction before Pandoc
- **Chart extraction**: Better chart data extraction (tables from visual charts via OCR)

### 5.4 Excel and CSV support (XLSX / XLS / CSV)

This section specifies Quill's support for tabular data formats: Excel workbooks (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV files (.csv, .tsv). The design prioritizes **accessible grid-based editing mode** as an alternative to traditional spreadsheet UIs, with keyboard-first navigation and accessibility-aware data quality analysis.

#### 5.4.1 Design Philosophy: Accessible Grid, Not Spreadsheet

Traditional spreadsheets (Excel, LibreOffice Calc) are visual-first and mouse-oriented. Quill reimagines grid editing for keyboard and screen-reader users:

- **Linear keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys move through cells top-to-bottom, left-to-right
- **F2 cell editing**: Edit mode restricted to cell content only; cursor never leaves the cell
- **Status bar context**: "Row 5, Column C (Sales): $75,000" announced before user types
- **Accessible sorting/filtering**: Shift+F10 or right-click to sort columns ascending/descending, filter by value
- **No visual formatting preserved**: Bold, colors, borders intentionally dropped (edit field is sacred)
- **All transformations in plain-text mode**: Pivot tables, transpose, statistics available without leaving CSV Mode

#### 5.4.2 Scope: CSV Mode as Universal Tabular Editor

**CSV files (native support):**

- Open directly in CSV Mode
- Auto-detect delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe)
- Auto-detect column types (text, integer, float, date, currency, boolean)
- User can toggle first row as column headers
- Full grid editing capabilities (add/delete rows/columns, sort, filter)
- Save back to CSV (or export to Excel, TSV, JSON, SQL, HTML, Markdown)

**Excel files (.xlsx / .xls) - via MarkItDown bridge:**

- Detect format on open
- Auto-convert to CSV using MarkItDown (primary) or openpyxl (fallback)
- Multi-sheet support: user prompted to load sheet, combine all, or create separate documents
- All CSV Mode features work on converted Excel data
- Save options: back to CSV, new Excel file, or export to original Excel format
- Legacy .xls (binary) support via openpyxl fallback

**Why CSV as universal format:**

- Plain-text, version-control friendly, universally accessible
- No hidden metadata, macro viruses, or formatting complexity
- MarkItDown converts any table → CSV automatically
- Screen-reader friendly; structure is explicit (headers, rows, columns)
- Easy to validate, transform, and audit

#### 5.4.3 CSV Mode UI and Keyboard Shortcuts

**Status bar in CSV Mode shows:**

```text
📊 CSV Mode (15 rows × 4 columns) | Headers: ✓ | Delimiter: Comma
```

**Navigation (arrow keys):**

- Arrow keys: Move to adjacent cell (up/down/left/right)
- Ctrl+Home: Go to cell A1 (first cell)
- Ctrl+End: Go to last cell with data
- Ctrl+Right/Left: Jump to next/previous non-empty cell in row
- Ctrl+Down/Up: Jump to next/previous non-empty cell in column
- Page Up / Page Down: Move up/down by 10 rows

**Cell editing (F2 mode):**

- Press F2 to enter edit mode for current cell
- Cursor restricted to cell content only; cannot move to adjacent cells
- Backspace/Delete/Ctrl+A work as expected within the cell
- Escape cancels edit without saving
- Enter commits and moves to next row
- Shift+Enter commits and moves to previous row

**Sorting and filtering (Shift+F10 / Right-click):**

- Shift+F10 or right-click to open column context menu
  - "Sort Ascending" (A→Z, 0→9, empty at bottom)
  - "Sort Descending" (Z→A, 9→0, empty at top)
  - "Move Column Left / Right"
  - "Delete Column / Insert Column"
  - "Filter by Value" (if headers present)
- Ctrl+Shift+L: Toggle filter row (when headers present)

**Selection (Shift+arrows):**

- Shift+Arrow keys: Extend selection to adjacent cells
- Shift+Spacebar: Select entire row
- Ctrl+A: Select all cells

#### 5.4.4 Transformational Features (Data Quality Analysis)

**Quick stats (Ctrl+Alt+S):**
When a numeric column is selected, Ctrl+Alt+S opens statistics panel showing Sum, Average, Median, Min, Max, Standard Deviation.

**Data validation and quality (Ctrl+Alt+V):**
Findings-based approach: detect empty cells, duplicates, type mismatches, outliers, inconsistent formatting with quality score and auto-fix suggestions.

**Pivot table (Ctrl+Alt+P):**
Group by column with aggregation (Sum, Average, Count, Min, Max).

**Transpose (Ctrl+Alt+T):**
Flip rows and columns.

**Find and replace with regex (Ctrl+H):**
Full regex support with capture groups.

**Concatenate / Split columns (Ctrl+Alt+C / Ctrl+Alt+X):**
Combine or split columns by delimiter.

**Unique values (Ctrl+Alt+U):**
Extract distinct values and create new sheet or copy to clipboard.

**Conditional formatting as comments (Ctrl+Alt+F):**
Mark cells based on conditions (e.g., "Salary > $90,000" adds comment).

#### 5.4.5 Multi-Sheet Excel Support

When opening Excel files with multiple sheets, user is prompted to load sheet, combine all, or create separate documents. Sheet navigation via Ctrl+Page Down/Up.

#### 5.4.6 Format Detection (Type Inference)

When opening CSV or Excel files, Quill auto-detects column types (Text, Integer, Float, Date, Boolean, Currency), date format, currency symbols, encoding, and delimiters with quality assessment.

#### 5.4.7 Save and Export Options

Users can save to CSV, TSV, Pipe-delimited, Excel (.xlsx), JSON, HTML table, Markdown table, or SQL INSERT statements with accessibility options (include column types, freeze headers, set widths).

#### 5.4.8 MarkItDown Integration for Universal Format Conversion

Quill uses Microsoft's MarkItDown library as a Tier 1 converter for Excel files, PDF tables, and web tables, converting all tabular formats to CSV for consistent editing.

#### 5.4.9 Data Quality and Accessibility Patterns
Built-in audits for column type consistency, dataset completeness, duplicate detection, and outlier analysis with actionable suggestions.

#### 5.4.10 Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test corpus including simple CSV, headers, mixed types, large files (10k rows), special characters, sparse data, malformed CSV, multi-sheet Excel, formulas, and legacy .xls files. Unit, integration, a11y, and performance tests all included.

#### 5.4.11 Safety and Security

- ✅ **Formula injection prevention**: CSV exports escape Excel formula indicators
- ✅ **Encoding safety**: Detects and preserves UTF-8, UTF-16, ANSI
- ✅ **Macro safety**: Excel macros NOT extracted or executed
- ✅ **Large file handling**: Warn if CSV > 50MB; streaming mode available
- ✅ **Local-only processing**: No network access

#### 5.4.12 Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Functional**: Users open CSV/Excel in accessible CSV Mode; grid navigation, sorting, filtering, transformations work
2. ✅ **Accessible**: Screen readers announce cell position/type/content; all operations keyboard-available
3. ✅ **Magical**: Quick stats, data quality audits, pivot tables, format conversion seamless
4. ✅ **Safe**: No formula injection; large files handled gracefully; macros never executed
5. ✅ **Tested**: Unit, integration, a11y, performance tests passing

#### 5.4.13 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

- **Inline formulas**: Support Excel-like formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, IF) in CSV cells
- **Data source connections**: Live links to external CSV/Excel for refresh
- **Advanced pivot UI**: Keyboard-accessible pivot table builder
- **Chart generation**: Text-based charts from CSV data
- **Database import**: Import from SQL, JSON, APIs
- **VLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH**: Lookup functions for multi-sheet joins
- **Macro recording**: Record/replay keyboard sequences
- **Data sanitization tools**: Trim spaces, standardize dates, fix typos

#### 5.4.14 Table Studio — the accessible grid (shipped, experimental)

**Goal.** One genuinely usable, screen-reader-first surface for building and
editing tables by ear — the accessible grid the CSV/tabular story above needs —
so a blind user can create a table, or open a CSV, and navigate it *cell by
cell* with the column spoken as they cross a row.

**One surface, two entry points.** `Tools > Table Studio` starts a new table;
`Tools > Open CSV in Table Studio` (and, when the feature is enabled, opening a
`.csv`/`.tsv` from `File > Open` in grid view) loads a file into the *same*
grid. This consolidates what were two grid implementations into one: the legacy
`CsvGridSurface` remains only as the fallback when Table Studio is disabled.

**Architecture.** A wx-free core (`quill/core/table_studio/`) owns the data — a
format-neutral `TableDocumentModel` (cells/rows/columns, listeners, Markdown +
HTML serialization), a `TableController` with a `SpokenCellFormatter` (Concise /
Standard / Detailed profiles, JAWS-style "changed header" announcing), and CSV
I/O with delimiter auto-detection. The UI (`quill/ui/table_studio.py`) renders
it on a virtual `wx.ListCtrl` (SysListView32) with a row-indexed MSAA provider
so NVDA/JAWS speak the active column; an **optional compiled native UIA
provider** (`quill/native/table_uia/`, pybind11 → `_quill_table_uia.pyd`,
staged into Windows builds when the toolchain is present) supplies richer
cell-level focus/value/structure events, with the MSAA path as a transparent
fallback.

**Interaction.** Arrow keys move by cell (Left/Right speak the column);
Home/End, Ctrl+Home/End, Page Up/Down navigate; F2/Enter edit; Alt+arrows move a
row or column; Ctrl+Insert adds a row; Delete clears a cell. A context menu
(Shift+F10 / Applications key / right-click) exposes every action: **Sort
Ascending/Descending** (numeric-aware, blanks last), **Insert/Delete/Move**
rows, **Insert/Delete** columns, **Rename Column Header**, **Promote First Row
to Header** (for a CSV whose header row was read as data), and **Use First
Column as Row Headers**. All the same actions are also on buttons.

**Industry-standard markup.** Column and row headers are stored and exported the
standard way — `<th scope="col">` / `<th scope="row">` in HTML and a proper
header row (with alignment markers) in Markdown — so the structure round-trips
and is legible to assistive technology and downstream tools. Finish by inserting
the table into the document as Markdown or HTML, or **Save to CSV** to write it
back to a file (a full round trip for an opened CSV).

**Gating & safety.** Experimental opt-in behind
`table_studio_experimental_enabled` (Preferences > Experimental), which follows
the Experimental master switch; the menu items appear only when it is on. No
network, no external process; the native provider is a pure enhancement that
never blocks a build or a run.

### 5.5 PDF handling in v1.0

This section is the canonical, scoped statement of what Quill 1.0 does with PDF files. Anything not listed here is explicitly out of scope for v1.0 and tracked in the backlog ([section 17](#17-backlog-and-deferred-items)).

**What v1.0 ships**

1. **Tier 1, local extraction (automatic on open).** A layered pipeline runs `pdfplumber` and `pypdfium2` (with `pdfminer.six` as a third fallback) per page, scores each extraction for readability (line count, alphabetic ratio, average line length, presence of suspicious one-word-per-line patterns), and picks the best result per page. Pages are concatenated with explicit page markers so page navigation is exact.
2. **Page navigation.** `Page Up` / `Page Down` move to the previous/next page marker. `Ctrl+G` opens Go To Page when page markers exist. The status bar's Page cell shows `Page n of m`. Reaching the first or last page is announced.
3. **Embedded bookmarks.** Bookmarks (Adobe's outline) become Quill bookmarks for that document and appear in the Outline Navigator (5.16) under their original hierarchy. They are read-only with respect to the original PDF; renaming, adding, and deleting affect Quill's own bookmark store.
4. **Password-protected PDFs.** On open, Quill prompts for the password through a standard modal dialog. The password is used in-memory only and is never written to disk, never logged, never sent over the network.
5. **Editable rendering, protected original.** The extracted text is presented in the standard editor. `Ctrl+S` opens **Save As** so the original `.pdf` cannot be overwritten by extracted text. The Save dialog offers Text, Markdown, HTML, and All Files.
6. **Document metadata.** Author, title, subject, keywords, creation date, modification date, and page count are accessible via `File > Document Properties…` and announced in Where Am I when the document is a PDF.
7. **PDF document statistics.** Document Statistics (5.19) reports page count, image count per page (informational), tagged-structure presence, and language metadata.
8. **Accessibility audit, informational.** The Accessibility Audit (5.20) reports whether the PDF has tagged structure, whether it has embedded bookmarks, the image-only page count, language metadata, and password protection state. It does not modify the PDF.
9. **Tier 3, AI-assisted reading order (opt-in, manual).** `Tools > Improve Reading Order…` sends the PDF to the user-configured LLM provider (the user supplies the API key; nothing is bundled). The action **always** asks for confirmation before sending, shows the host name and approximate size in the confirmation dialog, announces progress every ~20 seconds during the request, and reports the outcome. Refuses, with a clear spoken message, if the PDF exceeds the configured page-count limit (default 40). Results open as a new unsaved document whose Save defaults to Save As.
10. **OCR for scanned PDFs.** When tier 1 yields no readable text on a page, Quill offers a one-click escalation to local OCR via the bundled Tesseract (English shipped, additional languages downloadable). For longer scanned PDFs the user may instead escalate to tier 3 AI rendering.
11. **Selection and copy.** Standard selection works in the extracted text. `Ctrl+C` copies as plain text. There is no copy-with-formatting target in v1.0 (the extracted text has none).
12. **Find, Outline, Bookmarks, Word Count, Document Statistics, Read Aloud, Accessibility Audit** all work over the extracted text exactly as they do for any other document.
13. **Compare** (`Tools > Compare With File…`) works against the extracted text representation; comparing two PDFs compares their extracted plain-text forms.

**What v1.0 does not ship (deferred to backlog)**

- **Tier 2 "enhanced local" extractor.** No pure-Python local layout analyser meets the v1.0 quality bar. v1.0 has tier 1 and tier 3 only.
- **Heading synthesis from font-size analysis** when no embedded bookmarks exist. Off by default; available as an opt-in experimental switch in Advanced settings, clearly labelled as experimental.
- **PDF form filling and signing.** Not in v1.0.
- **Writing back to PDF** (annotation, highlight, comment). Not in v1.0; original PDF is read-only by design.
- **Embedded media** (audio, video, 3D, attachments inside the PDF). Not in v1.0.
- **XFA forms.** Not in v1.0.
- **Tagged-structure tree editor.** Reading the structure summary is in; editing it is backlog.

### 5.6 Improve reading order

A general action under Tools and the command palette:

- For text-based documents, sends the current document text to the configured LLM for layout repair.
- For PDF and legacy DOC, sends the original file so text boxes and visual columns can be analysed.
- For PPTX, can send the file when local extraction is insufficient.
- Always asks first. Never used to answer questions about the document.
- Result opens as a new unsaved document; Save defaults to Save As.

### 5.7 HTML and Markdown

- HTML files open as plain text in the editor.
- `File > Preview as HTML` writes a temporary HTML file and opens the default browser.
- Markdown files open as plain text.
- `File > Preview Markdown as HTML` renders via `markdown-it-py` and opens the browser.
- `File > Export Markdown as HTML` saves a standalone HTML file.
- `File > Export Markdown as Word` produces a `.docx` via `python-docx`, preserving headings, lists, links, tables, code blocks.

### 5.8 Find and replace

Find in Quill is designed to feel like Microsoft editors and Visual Studio Code at the same time: F3 just works once a term is known, the search term is remembered everywhere it makes sense, and everything is announced.

**The search term, the central concept.** Quill maintains a single "current search term" per editor. The term is set by any of:

- typing in the Find dialog and pressing Enter,
- pressing `Ctrl+F3` with a selection (the selection becomes the search term),
- pressing `Ctrl+F3` with no selection (the word under the cursor becomes the search term),
- restoring it from session storage on launch (when enabled),
- arrow-selecting a previous term from the Find dialog's history dropdown.

The status bar's **Search term** cell (5.1b) displays the current search term and its options. `Enter` on the cell reopens Find pre-filled.

**Keystrokes**

- `Ctrl+F` opens Find. Pressing Enter searches forward, sets the search term, selects the match, and announces `Found on line 12: <line text>`.
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` opens Find anchored to backwards search.
- `F3` advances to the **next** occurrence of the current search term without opening any dialog. If no term is set, F3 opens Find with focus in the input. If a term is set, F3 simply selects the next match and announces line + context. At end of document, search wraps to the start (announced as "Wrapped to top").
- `Shift+F3` does the same in reverse, wrapping at the start to the end ("Wrapped to bottom").
- `Ctrl+F3` sets the current word or selection as the search term and advances. `Ctrl+Shift+F3` sets it and retreats. This is the Visual Studio convention.
- `Alt+F3` opens **Find All**: a list of every match with line number and context line, in a stock `wx.ListBox`. Enter jumps to a match; the dialog stays open so the user can iterate. The cell at the bottom shows `Match 3 of 17`.
- `Ctrl+H` opens Replace. Options: case sensitive, whole word, regex, **in selection** (pre-checked when a selection is present on open). Replace, Replace All, Find Next, Find Previous buttons. Replace All reports `Replaced 12 occurrences`. Undo is one step.
- `Esc` from any Find or Replace dialog closes it and returns focus to the editor at the previous cursor position (not at the last match unless the user pressed Enter).
- **"Not found"** is always spoken, never silent. After two consecutive not-found beeps, Quill suggests opening Find All to verify the term.

**History and persistence**

- Find and Replace remember the last 20 terms per session (in-memory) and the last 100 across sessions (on-disk, in `%APPDATA%\Quill\search-history.json`; cleared from a single button in Settings → Privacy). Replacement strings have their own parallel history.
- The dropdown arrow on the Find input opens history; Up/Down arrows in the input cycle through history when the input is empty.

**Incremental preview (opt-in, off by default)**

- A Settings switch `Editing → Incremental Find Preview` makes the editor preview the next match as the user types in the Find dialog (Notepad++ style). Escape returns the cursor to where it was before Find opened. Enter commits and closes. Off by default because preview-driven cursor movement can confuse screen readers; we expose it for users who prefer it.

**Predictable announcements**

- On every match Quill announces a structured one-liner: `Found on line N: <line text>`. The line text is truncated to 200 characters with an ellipsis to keep speech short. Long lines are abbreviated around the match so the matched text is always in the spoken slice.
- On wrap: `Wrapped to top` or `Wrapped to bottom`, followed by the match announcement.
- On Replace All: `Replaced N occurrences in document` or `Replaced N occurrences in selection`.
- On regex error: a single sentence, no traceback.

**Find in current selection.** When the editor has a non-empty selection at the moment Find or Replace is opened, the "In selection" checkbox is pre-checked; Replace All scopes its work to the selection. F3 and Shift+F3 continue to operate document-wide regardless, because muscle memory expects that.

**Find next while typing.** When the Find dialog is closed and the search term is set, typing in the editor does not interfere with F3; the search term is preserved until the user clears it (`Ctrl+Shift+\` or status-bar cell context menu → Clear Search).

**Project-wide Find (Find in Folder)** is deferred to v1.2.

### 5.9 Spell checking (local-first, guided F7 review)

This section was significantly expanded in v0.2 of this PRD. See [section 6](#6-spell-checking-deep-dive) for the full architecture and decision rationale, and [§6.4](#64-f7-spelling-review-full-specification) for the complete F7 dialog specification.

QUILL ships **its own spell checking engine**, built on Hunspell dictionaries, designed from the ground up for screen-reader speed and predictability. It does **not** depend on TinySpell or any other external spell-checker process.

- **`F7`** opens the **Spelling Review** dialog — a guided, modal, fully keyboard-operable review of every misspelling in the document or active selection. The dialog surfaces each issue inside a readable, navigable, sentence-level context window. See §6.4 for the complete specification. **Implemented in 0.7.0 Beta 2.**
- **`Ctrl+F7` / `Ctrl+Shift+F7`** jump to the next or previous misspelling without leaving the editor.
- **`Alt+F7`** (`tools.spell_check_word_at_cursor`) — **Spell Check Word, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3.** Checks only the word at the caret (or the current selection), with no full-document scan. A correctly spelled word is announced and nothing else happens; a misspelling opens the same suggestions/Add to Dictionary/Ignore choices as the right-click spelling context menu (reusing `suggest_words`/`misspelling_at_position` from the spell-check core), in a lightweight `wx.SingleChoiceDialog` rather than the full Spelling Review dialog. The keyboard equivalent of pressing F7 on a focused word in Microsoft Office.
- **`Ctrl+Shift+L`** (`tools.misspelling_list_ranked`) — **Ranked spelling, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3, community feature request (Kurzweil 1000 parity).** Opens the same tree-navigator dialog as the existing document-order `tools.misspelling_list` (`Alt+Shift+L`), but ordered by `rank_misspellings_by_frequency()` (new, pure, in `core/spellcheck.py`): most-recurring word first, case-insensitive grouping, ties broken by first-occurrence position for a stable/reproducible order. Each entry's label includes its occurrence count (`_build_misspelling_navigator_nodes(..., show_counts=True)`). Rationale: a single OCR misread or repeated typo often accounts for the bulk of a long misspelling list, so fixing the most-frequent entry first clears the most ground fastest. Pure reordering — every occurrence still appears in the result, nothing is deduplicated or hidden.
- As-you-type checking is on by default. Misspellings are tracked in a sidecar model (not visual squiggles) and announced gently on word boundary if the user opts in.
- Suggestions come from Hunspell plus an n-gram reranker trained on the user's writing for personalised top suggestions.
- Personal dictionary persists per user; per-document dictionary persists in a sidecar file.
- Multiple simultaneous dictionaries: e.g. English (UK) plus a technical jargon list plus the document's own dictionary, merged with priority.
- All entirely local. No cloud round-trip ever for spell check.

### 5.10 Word count and navigation

- `Ctrl+Shift+W` reports words, characters, and paragraphs. Reports on selection if present.
- `Page Up` / `Page Down` navigate by real page markers (PDF). Announces page on move.
- `Ctrl+G` opens Go To Line, or Go To Page when page markers exist.

### 5.10 Bookmarks

- Bookmarks are **named jump points** intended for durable anchors a user wants to revisit by name.
- `Ctrl+B` sets a bookmark at the current position. Prompts for a name.
- Stored per bookmark: name, line number, column, ~120 characters of surrounding text, document path, ISO timestamp.
- `Ctrl+Shift+G` opens Bookmarks Manager.
- On jump: if the stored line still contains the surrounding text, go there. If not, search for the surrounding text and update the bookmark. If still not found, fall back to line number and announce "approximate position."
- Bookmarks for saved documents persist in `%APPDATA%\Quill\bookmarks\<hash>.json`.

**Note:** the section above predates the shipped implementation and describes an earlier design (`Ctrl+B`, surrounding-text fuzzy resolution); the as-shipped named-bookmark commands (`navigate.set_bookmark`/`go_to_bookmark`/`list_bookmarks`, default `Alt+Shift+B` for List Bookmarks) live in `quill/core/bookmarks.py` and `MainFrame`, storing name→position pairs per document via `DocumentMemory`. Reconciling this section with the shipped design is a separate follow-up; the two additions below are accurate as of 0.9.0 Beta 3.

**Temporary bookmark — shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3.** A single unnamed, one-shot jump point, distinct from named bookmarks: `Ctrl+Shift+K` sets it at the cursor with no dialog; `Alt+Shift+K` jumps to it with no picker. Session-only by design (never written to `DocumentMemory`) — it is disposable scratch state, not a durable anchor. Implemented as `MainFrame.set_temp_bookmark`/`go_to_temp_bookmark`, aliased per-tab exactly like the named-bookmark dict.

**Numbered quick bookmarks — shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3.** Ten fixed slots (0-9). The original design (see the now-superseded PRD draft in `x.md`) proposed routing set/jump through Quick Nav's "press a letter, then a qualifier" grammar; direct user feedback during review asked for one-keystroke access with no sub-mode, so the shipped implementation instead intercepts `Alt+Shift+<digit>` (set) and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+<digit>` (jump) directly in `MainFrame._on_char_hook`, alongside the existing frame-level `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+W` handling — the declarative keymap table has no "any digit" wildcard, so these 20 chords are intercepted rather than declared. Deliberately *not* a parallel storage system: `quick_slot_name(slot)` in `core/bookmarks.py` generates a reserved name (`"Quick 3"`) that reuses the existing named-bookmark store, so numbered bookmarks get persistence, save/load, and crash-safety for free rather than needing a new `DocumentMemory` schema field.

**Favorite folders — shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3, community feature request.** A short, user-curated list of folders (`quill/core/favorite_folders.py`, wx-free, modeled on `BookmarkVault`), distinct from Windows' recency-based recent-folders. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A`/`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` add/remove the current document's folder; `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O` opens **Open From Favorite Folder** — a VSCode-Quick-Open-style type-to-filter dialog (`list_files_in_favorites`/`filter_favorite_files`, both pure and unit-tested) scanning every favorite folder's top-level files (non-recursive by design, to keep the filter instant) and matching by case-insensitive filename substring. Quill has no single-project-root "workspace" concept to scan the way VSCode does, so this is intentionally scoped to the curated favorites list rather than the whole disk.

### 5.11 Selection helpers and Where Am I

- `Ctrl+Shift+,` marks selection anchor; `Ctrl+Shift+.` extends selection.
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` Where Am I. In the editor: line, column, word count, modified state, page if available. In dialogs: structured description of the current field.

### 5.12 Command palette (Visual Studio Code style)

This is a centrepiece of v0.2. See [section 7](#7-command-palette-deep-dive) for the complete design.

- Single shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (also `F1`).
- Prefix-driven modes inside one input field, exactly like VS Code:
  - No prefix: command search.
  - `>` explicit command prefix (typing it is optional; a fresh palette starts in command mode).
  - `?` shows help for available prefixes.
  - `:` go to line.
  - `@` go to bookmark in current document.
  - `#` go to bookmark across all open documents.
  - `!` show warnings and errors (spell check issues, broken bookmarks, unsupported features used).
  - `<` open a recent file.
  - `~` switch open document.
  - `=` open a setting.
- Fuzzy matching with subsequence scoring, recency boost, and frequency boost (most-recently-used commands float to the top).
- Each row shows: command title, current keybinding, source (core or plugin), and a short hint.
- Right-arrow on a command edits its keybinding inline (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)).
- Fully keyboard driven. Standard `wx.ListBox` underneath, with a `wx.SearchCtrl` on top. All accessible via stock screen-reader behaviour.

### 5.13 Document backups

- On every save of an existing file, the previous saved bytes are copied to `%APPDATA%\Quill\backups\<hash>\<iso-timestamp>.bak`.
- `File > Restore Document Backup` lists backups for the current document, newest first.
- Restore prompts for confirmation. Before overwriting the editor, the current buffer is backed up too.
- Restored text is marked modified; user saves with `Ctrl+S`.
- Retention: default keep last 50 per document, prune older than 90 days, never delete the most recent 5.
- Crash recovery: autosave snapshot every 30 seconds while a document is dirty; on launch, Quill offers to recover any orphan snapshots.

### 5.14 Settings

`Ctrl+,` opens Settings, organised in a `wx.Treebook`:

- **General**, **Editing**, **Reading**, **Spell check**, **PDF and AI**, **Files**, **Appearance**, **Backups**, **Keyboard** (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)), **Privacy**.

#### 5.14a Persistence and migration contract

All persisted user state follows one release-to-release contract so upgrades never strand users, hide new defaults, or pin stale ones. Canonical reference: `docs/design/persistence-and-migration.md`.

- **Defaults in code; disk stores only the delta.** Each store (`settings.json`, `keymap.json`, `features.json`) persists only the fields the user changed from the code-defined default, plus a schema/epoch version stamp. Consequences: a newly added setting arrives at its default automatically (absent from old files); a changed default reaches every user who did not override that field; user customizations are the only thing written, so they survive verbatim. A full snapshot — the prior `settings.json` shape (`schema_version` 1) and the prior `keymap.json` shape — pinned every field and was the root cause of changed defaults never reaching users; both are now deltas (`schema_version` 2 / `_defaults_epoch` 1).
- **Migrate-and-back-up on load.** A file predating the current schema is rewritten to the canonical delta exactly once; the original is first copied to `migration-backups/<store>-v<old>-<timestamp>.json` (most-recent-few retained) so the conversion is reversible. Validation is field-by-field: a corrupt value falls back to its default without discarding siblings. Persistence is best-effort (a read-only/locked dir never blocks startup).
- **Reusable plumbing.** `quill/core/versioned_store.py` (`load_with_migration(path, *, store_name, parse, serialize, is_legacy, default)`) encapsulates the load→migrate→backup→resave dance; `quill/core/migration_backup.py` provides the shared pre-migration backup. A new store supplies four callables; a new schema bump changes `serialize`/`parse` and raises the version. Settings serialization lives in `quill/core/settings_migration.py`.
- **Recommended (force-once) updates.** When an *important* default change must reach users who already overrode the field (canonical case: restoring Find to `Ctrl+F`), `quill/core/recommended_updates.py` holds a versioned registry of `RecommendedKeymapUpdate`s. Each applies at most once per user — the applied id is recorded in `settings.applied_recommended_updates` — then the binding is never force-touched again. The whole mechanism is opt-out via `settings.apply_recommended_keymap_updates` (default on); applied at startup by `MainFrame._apply_recommended_keymap_updates()` after settings + keymap load.
- **Migration notice (surfacing).** A rich `migration_notice` setting (`silent` / `announce` / `prompt`, default `announce`; Administration group, searchable spec) controls how a migration is surfaced. `migration_backup.pop_recent_migrations()` reports stores migrated this launch; `MainFrame._surface_migration_notice()` (a startup task) briefly announces or shows a summary dialog accordingly. Recommended keymap updates are reversible: `_apply_recommended_keymap_updates` captures the prior bindings, and `undo_recommended_keymap_updates()` (command `tools.undo_recommended_updates`, and the prompt's Undo button) restores them while leaving the update ids marked applied so the change does not re-fire.
- **One-time startup maintenance.** `quill/core/startup_maintenance.py` runs epoch-gated, run-once cleanups of regenerable diagnostic clutter (`logs/`, `crash-reports/`, `diagnostics/`) so upgraders from the early beta start clean. It runs in `quill.__main__.main()` after `ensure_app_directories()` and before `configure_logging()` (so clearing `logs/` is safe), gated by a `startup-maintenance.json` marker; it never touches documents, autosaves, backups, recovery, or settings.
- **Installer interaction.** The Windows installer (`scripts/build_windows_distribution.py`, `[InstallDelete]`) cleanly replaces the first-party `quill` package (and stray `__pycache__`) on every install to prevent version-skew import crashes, while leaving the embedded runtime, bundled tools, and `%APPDATA%\Quill` user data untouched — the migration contract above, not an installer wipe, is what keeps config safe across releases.
- **Reset surfaces.** Each subsystem has a factory reset behind a warning: Settings dialog **Reset to Factory Defaults** (`registry.reset_all`), **Reset Keymap** (`reset_keymap`), and the Menu Editor reset. A unified **Reset Everything to Factory Defaults** (`tools.reset_all_defaults`, `MainFrame.reset_all_to_factory_defaults`, in Tools → Customize & Support) resets settings + keymap + menu customization + feature profile in one confirmed step; each writes its clean factory delta, and user documents/autosaves/backups/recovery are never touched.

### 5.15 Plugin system (v1.1)

- Plugins are Python packages discovered in `%APPDATA%\Quill\plugins`.
- Each plugin can register commands, file format readers and writers, settings pages, palette entries, and **default keybindings** (which the user can override).
- Plugin manifest must declare network and filesystem use.

### 5.16 Outline Navigator (heading tree)

One of Quill's signature productivity wins for readers and writers. Opens a tree of every heading in the current document, fully accessible, and lets the user jump anywhere in two keystrokes.

- `Ctrl+Shift+H` opens the Outline Navigator. The window contains a filter `wx.SearchCtrl`, a `wx.TreeCtrl` of headings, and standard OK/Cancel/Jump buttons. Everything stock; screen readers handle it natively.
- The outline is computed deterministically per format:
  - **Markdown**: ATX (`#`) and Setext (`===`, `---`) headings, parsed via `markdown-it-py` AST.
  - **HTML/XHTML/MHTML**: `<h1>`…`<h6>` and `<section><h*>` patterns via `beautifulsoup4`. ARIA `role="heading" aria-level="n"` is honoured.
  - **reStructuredText**: title underline conventions via `docutils`.
  - **AsciiDoc**: `=` through `======` lines.
  - **Org-mode**: `*` through `******` lines.
  - **LaTeX/Typst**: `\part`, `\chapter`, `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection`, `\paragraph`; Typst `= heading` syntax.
  - **DOCX**: paragraphs styled Heading 1–9 (via `python-docx`).
  - **EPUB**: `nav.xhtml` first, falling back to `toc.ncx`.
  - **PDF**: embedded document bookmarks (the same tree shown in Adobe Reader's bookmarks pane); also synthesised from font-size analysis when no bookmarks exist (opt-in, off by default).
  - **DAISY**: navigation document.
  - **Subtitle files**: chapter markers if present; otherwise time-bucketed sections every five minutes.
  - **Jupyter notebooks**: each Markdown heading inside Markdown cells, plus a synthetic node per cell.
  - **Generic fallback**: lines that look like headings (ALL CAPS short lines, numbered sections like `1.`, `1.1`) are offered as a flat list with a warning that the document has no real structure.
- Tree behaviour:
  - Up/Down arrow navigates between headings. Right Arrow expands; Left Arrow collapses. `*` (numpad or shift+8) expands all descendants of the focused node.
  - Typing in the filter field narrows the visible tree to headings whose text matches (substring, case-insensitive). The first match is announced. `Tab` returns focus to the tree.
  - `Enter` jumps the editor to the selected heading, closes the dialog, and announces `Jumped to heading level 2: <text>`.
  - `F2` renames the heading in place (editable formats only) and updates the document.
  - `Ctrl+C` copies the heading title; `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the path (`Chapter 3 › Section 2 › Subsection 1`).
- The Outline Navigator also lives in the command palette under the `#` prefix when the current document has structure, so headings appear inline with document switching.
- Targets: build the tree for any text-based document up to 1 MB in under 50 ms; up to 10 MB in under 500 ms.

### 5.17 Jump-by-structure shortcuts

In-editor navigation by document structure, alongside the Outline dialog:

- `Ctrl+PgDn` / `Ctrl+PgUp`: next / previous heading of any level. Announces `Heading level 2: <text>`.
- `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+6`: next heading of level 1–6. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1–6` for previous.
- `Ctrl+Alt+0`: jump to the next paragraph that is not a heading (useful for skimming).
- `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[`: next / previous block boundary (code fence, list, table, blockquote) in Markdown and HTML.
- `Ctrl+Alt+B`: jump to the start of the current logical block; `Ctrl+Alt+E` to the end.
- All shortcuts reassignable.

### 5.18 Line and block operations

VS Code-style editor productivity, all standard text-control operations:

- `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down`: move the current line (or all selected lines) up or down. Announces the swap.
- `Ctrl+Shift+D`: duplicate the current line or selection.
- `Ctrl+Shift+K`: delete the entire current line.
- `Ctrl+L`: select the current line (repeat to extend by line).
- `Ctrl+J`: join the current and next line with a single space.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` on a multi-line selection: indent or outdent.
- `Ctrl+/`: toggle line comment using the current document's comment marker (`#`, `//`, `<!-- -->`, etc.).
- `Ctrl+Shift+/`: toggle block comment where supported.
- **Tools menu**: Sort Selected Lines (ascending/descending, case-sensitive option, natural-numeric option), Remove Duplicate Lines, Reverse Lines, Trim Trailing Whitespace, Convert Indent (tabs↔spaces), Normalize Whitespace, Wrap to Column N.
- **Smart list continuation** (Markdown, opt-in): pressing Enter on a `-`, `*`, or `1.` line continues the list and increments numeric markers; pressing Enter on an empty list item ends the list.
- **Bracket and quote auto-pair** (off by default; per-format toggle in Settings). Never enabled in plain text.

### 5.19 Document statistics and reading metrics

Local, instant, never sends content anywhere.

- `Ctrl+Alt+S` opens the Document Statistics dialog.
- Reports: characters with and without spaces, words, sentences, paragraphs, lines, headings per level, links, images, code blocks, tables, footnotes.
- Estimated reading time at a configurable rate (default 200 wpm) and speaking time (default 150 wpm).
- Readability scores: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog, SMOG, Automated Readability Index. Each line in the dialog is a separate `wx.StaticText` so screen readers can read them one at a time.
- Longest sentence (with click-to-jump), average sentence length, longest paragraph.
- If a selection exists, statistics report on the selection and the title says so explicitly.
- Status bar shows running word count for the current document or selection.

### 5.20 Accessibility auditor

Quill's audience is exactly the audience that needs to _produce_ accessible documents. v1.0 ships a first-class auditor.

- `Ctrl+Alt+A` runs an Accessibility Audit on the current document and opens the Issues dialog. (The same list is reachable via the command palette `!` prefix.)
- **Markdown and HTML** checks: heading-level skips (h2 to h4), missing or empty `alt` text on images, `alt` text equal to the filename, generic link text (`click here`, `here`, `read more`, `link`), empty links, duplicate link text pointing to different targets, tables without header rows, deeply nested lists (>5), paragraphs longer than 500 words, missing `lang` attribute on `<html>`, missing page title.
- **DOCX** checks: missing alt text on inline images, heading-style skips, generic link text, tables without header rows, document language not set, missing title.
- **PDF** checks (informational): whether the PDF has any tagged structure, presence of embedded bookmarks, image-only page count, language metadata, password protection.
- **Markdown front-matter** checks: required keys present (configurable per project).
- Issues panel: list with severity (error/warning/info), location, message, and “Why this matters” explanation. `Enter` jumps to the issue, `Delete` dismisses for the session, `Ctrl+I` ignores the rule in this document (persisted in the document's sidecar).
- Two companion catalogs:
  - **Alt-text catalog** (`Ctrl+Alt+I`): every image with its current alt text, edit in place for editable formats, jump-to-source.
  - **Link inventory** (`Ctrl+Alt+L`): every link with target and accessible name; flags duplicates and internal-vs-external; copy URLs.
- Audit completes in under 200 ms for documents up to 100 KB; up to 5 s for documents up to 5 MB.

### 5.21 Table mode for Markdown and HTML tables

When the editor cursor enters a Markdown pipe table, a Markdown grid table, or an HTML `<table>`, Quill enters Table Mode and announces it.

- `Ctrl+Shift+Right` / `Ctrl+Shift+Left`: next or previous cell; the column header is announced first, then the cell content (`Column "Price": $4.99`).
- `Ctrl+Shift+Down` / `Ctrl+Shift+Up`: next or previous row in the same column.
- `F2`: open the current cell in a small editor dialog with the column header in the title.
- `Ctrl+Alt+T`: insert a row below; `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T`: insert a column after.
- `Ctrl+Alt+R`: delete the current row; `Ctrl+Alt+C`: delete the current column. Both confirm.
- `Ctrl+Alt+H`: toggle the current row as the header row (Markdown only).
- Tables remain valid Markdown or HTML on save: Quill re-aligns pipes and pads columns on every edit so the underlying text stays readable as plain text.

### 5.21a Structured List Studio (F2) — shipped

Build and edit lists by concept, not syntax, so the user never types `-`, `1.`,
`[ ]`, `<ul>`, or `<dl>` by hand. The design PRD was retired to git history once
delivered; this section is the canonical record. Implementation: wx-free
`quill/core/lists/` (model, parse/interpretation, render, nesting, convert,
validate, settings, announce — fully unit-tested) behind
`quill/ui/list_studio_dialog.py` and `list_studio_settings_dialog.py`.

- **Context-sensitive F2** (also Insert > List > Structured List Studio…): turns a
  selection into a list or starts a new one; with the caret inside an existing list
  and no selection, loads that block to edit and rewrites just it. F2 displaced
  Insert Special Character to Shift+F2 with a legacy-binding migration. Excellent
  defaults work with no Settings visit.
- **Four types** (Bulleted / Numbered / Checklist / Definition) in Markdown or HTML,
  with a live read-only source preview and an accessible items/entries outline that
  announces text, number/checked state, and position. Apply is one undoable edit.
- **Nesting** (Indent / Outdent / Add child; Move up/down carries a subtree),
  **multiple terms and definitions per entry** (multiple `<dt>` / `<dd>`),
  **type-switch conversion** with information-loss confirmation, **import** from
  clipboard/file with the preview as the interpretation, and **reparse-and-validate
  before commit** (rejects an empty list, a term-less definition entry, or injected
  markup, leaving the document unchanged).
- **Definition-list Markdown profile** (§7.6/§21.3): HTML emits semantic
  `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>`; Markdown follows a configurable profile (Pandoc / Markdown
  Extra / MultiMarkdown / embedded HTML / plain). When no profile is configured for
  the document, QUILL **prompts** — embedded HTML (recommended), a native profile,
  or a plain "Term: Definition" list — rather than silently guessing.
- **Settings/presets with scoped precedence (§3).** Effective settings resolve as
  app-default → format → document → this-operation (`quill/core/lists/scopes.py`;
  workspace is a supported layer with no source today, §3 "where applicable"). The
  app-default persists in `settings.list_studio_settings`; the format scope pins
  the definition-Markdown profile to the document's markup; a per-document override
  lives on the document (`source_metadata["list_studio_override"]`, stored as the
  diff from the app-default); and the **List Studio Settings** dialog saves for
  *all documents* or *this document only*.
- **Remaining:** a formal live screen-reader pass (JAWS/NVDA/Narrator) — manual,
  tracked in `docs/planning/roadmap.md` §1.8.

### 5.22 Editor essentials

A group of small, individually unremarkable features whose absence would feel cheap. All ship in v1.0.

- **Encoding picker**: `File > Open With Encoding…`, `File > Reload With Encoding…`. Status bar shows the active encoding. Auto-detection on open via `charset-normalizer`; user can always override.
- **Line endings**: `File > Line Endings` (LF, CRLF, CR). Status bar shows the active style. “Convert on save” is an opt-in setting.
- **Reload from disk**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`. If the editor has unsaved changes, prompt.
- **External-change watcher**: detect when the file changes outside Quill; offer to reload (auto-reload if the editor is unmodified).
- **Insert date / time**: `Ctrl+Alt+D` (with a one-time format chooser that the user can re-open from Settings).
- **Templates**: `File > New From Template…`. Templates live in `%APPDATA%\Quill\templates\`. Ships with: Markdown article, Meeting notes, Daily journal, Letter, Issue report, README, Changelog, MIT license header, Markdown blog post with front-matter.
- **Word prediction**: `Ctrl+.` opens an IntelliSense-style picker for document words plus HTML and Markdown tag completions. It can also run automatically while typing when enabled in Settings.
- **Snippets**: per-format snippet packs with trigger + Tab expansion. `Ctrl+Alt+Space` opens Insert Snippet; `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Space` opens Manage Snippets. Off by default in prose, on by default in code. Editable in Settings.
- **Save options** (per document and per workspace): trim trailing whitespace on save, ensure final newline, normalise line endings on save.
- **Smart paste**: by default, strip rich-text formatting when pasting from sources that include it.
- **Sessions**: `File > Save Session…` and `File > Open Session…` preserve the set of open documents and per-document cursor position.
- **Print**: `Ctrl+P` opens the system print dialog, preserving the editor font and encoding.
- **Extract to plain text**: `Tools > Save As Plain Text` works for any opened format and is the canonical way to harvest text from a non-editable source.
- **Compare two documents**: `Tools > Compare With File…` supports an interactive compare session and can also produce a unified-diff document in a new editor tab. Interactive compare mode moves the cursor between differing line groups, offers a difference list, and supports synchronized compare navigation. Diff hunks remain navigable with `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[`.

### 5.23 Recent locations history (browser-style back/forward)

- `Ctrl+Alt+Left` moves back through cursor jump points; `Ctrl+Alt+Right` moves forward.
- Push triggers: Find match, F3/Shift+F3 jump, bookmark jump, outline jump, Go To Line, Go To Page, opening a document, switching documents.
- The ring holds up to 100 entries per editor, deduplicated when consecutive entries collapse to the same line.
- A small `Navigate → List Recent Locations…` dialog shows the ring as a list with document, line, and the line text; Enter jumps. Stock `wx.ListBox`.
- Each location remembers document path, line, column, and a hash of nearby text so jumps survive small edits exactly as bookmarks do (5.10).

### 5.24 Mark ring

A second, lighter-weight navigation system for power users. Inspired by Emacs but adapted to Windows muscle memory.
Marks are **temporary jump points**; bookmarks (5.10) are named and more durable.

- `Ctrl+Shift+M` sets an anonymous mark at the cursor; status bar briefly announces `Mark set`.
- `Ctrl+M` pops to the most recent mark; further presses walk back through the ring.
- `Ctrl+Shift+X` exchanges point (cursor) and mark, useful for jumping to where the user was and back.
- `Edit → Mark Ring → List Marks…` shows the ring in a stock `wx.ListBox` with document, line, column, and surrounding text snippet.
- Up to 50 marks in a circular buffer per session. Marks do not persist across sessions in v1.0.
- All keystrokes reassignable. `Ctrl+.` is reserved for Word Prediction by default, so users who rely on another screen-reader chord can reassign it; the conflict detector (8.4) flags the well-known cases at install time.

### 5.25 Read Aloud (secondary voice, not the screen reader)

Quill ships a read-aloud feature that uses a **secondary** voice the user picks from a list. It deliberately does not compete with the screen reader: the screen reader keeps doing its job while read-aloud plays, and the user can use a different voice for each so they are easy to tell apart.

- Backend: SAPI 5 voices and Windows OneCore voices via `pywin32`/`comtypes`. Detected at startup; the list is presented in `Settings → Read Aloud` and in the Read Aloud voice chooser.
- `Ctrl+Alt+P` starts/pauses read-aloud from the current cursor; `Ctrl+Alt+S` stops; `Ctrl+Alt+.` skips to the next sentence; `Ctrl+Alt+,` previous.
- Granularity: sentence by default; settings allow paragraph or word.
- Follow cursor (optional, off by default): the **Move cursor to follow Read Aloud** setting (`Settings → Read Aloud`; `read_aloud_follow_cursor`) selects each sentence in the editor as it is spoken so the cursor tracks the reading and stops where the user last heard. It is **off by default** because, with a screen reader running, moving the selection makes the screen reader announce the selection ("...selected") over the Read Aloud voice; sighted and low-vision users can opt in. The status bar's Read Aloud cell shows progress regardless of the setting.
- Selection-only mode: when invoked with a selection, read-aloud reads only the selection and stops at the end.
- Voice, speed, pitch, volume all configurable. Three named profiles (Reading, Proofreading, Skim) save preferred values.
- The read-aloud voice never overrides the screen reader's announcements; if a screen reader speaks something while read-aloud is active, read-aloud continues but is briefly ducked.

**Read Document in Browser (experimental, opt-in — `edge_read_aloud_enabled`).** The embedded WebView2 only exposes the local SAPI voices; a *real* browser exposes its full Web Speech voice set, including Edge's "Online (Natural)" voices. So, gated behind **Settings → Experimental** (and the experimental acknowledgement), QUILL can build a self-contained, accessible reader page (`quill/core/browser_reader.py`: labelled voice picker, Speed, Play/Pause/Stop, an `aria-live` status, keyboard focus on Play, the document text carrying its own `lang`) and open it in the user's chosen browser via the existing preview-open path. The page builder is wx-free and unit-tested. **Privacy contract:** QUILL itself makes no network call for this; on-device voices synthesize locally, but the browser's "Online (Natural)" voices synthesize in the vendor's cloud, so choosing one sends the selected text to that service. This is disclosed in the setting description and in the network-egress audit's documented (out-of-package) egress notes; the generated page carries the full document text as plaintext in app-data and is therefore **deleted on exit** (`browser_reader.remove_reader_pages`) so no copy lingers. Playback speaks chunk-by-chunk and treats Stop's `interrupted`/`canceled` events as normal teardown (never surfaced as errors).

#### Voice preview feedback

Voice preview (Voice Browser dialog and the Download Optional Components hub's Test button) reports its own state: starting a new preview always stops/supersedes a prior one (no overlapping audio or announcements), a one-shot "generating, please wait" cue (earcon + optional spoken announcement, `voice_preview_announce_generating`, default on) fires only when synthesis is still running after a short delay, and the Preview/Test button toggles to Stop while a preview is generating or playing. No true pause/resume; Stop cancels outright. An in-flight external synthesis call that gets superseded is not force-killed — it completes in the background and its result is discarded.

#### Reliability fixes (2026-07-08)

A batch of fixes from real user feedback and crash reports, landed alongside voice preview feedback:

- **Sound backend on macOS.** `quill/platform/sound_player.py`'s `_detect_backend()` previously tried only `sound_lib` (a licensed engine excluded from every build) and `winsound` (Windows-only), so macOS had no audio backend at all and every earcon — including the bundled Ink pack, which *is* correctly included in the `.app` bundle — was silently unplayable. Added an AppKit `NSSound` backend via `pyobjc` (already a `macos` build extra, used elsewhere for screen-reader announcements).
- **AI Setup Wizard stuck-active state.** `SdkHarness.is_available()` and `sdk_install.is_pack_importable()` only confirmed `importlib.util.find_spec()`, which a partially-written (crash-interrupted) `pip install --target` still satisfies. Both now attempt a real `importlib.import_module`, so an interrupted install correctly reports as not-installed and the existing Set Up retry path works.
- **macOS file-open + keybinding gaps.** `run_app()` now constructs a `MacOpenFileApp` (`quill/ui/mac_open_file_app.py`) overriding `wx.App.MacOpenFile`/`MacOpenFiles`, since Finder/Dock/`open -a` file-open requests arrive via an Apple Event, not `argv`, and QUILL previously never saw them. `_parse_keybinding` gained `cmd`/`command` as `ACCEL_CTRL` aliases (any `Cmd+...` binding, including the already-shipped back/forward-location shortcuts, previously produced no accelerator table entry at all on any platform). Document switching gets a darwin-specific default (`Cmd+Shift+]`/`[`) since `Ctrl+Tab` maps to macOS's reserved App Switcher shortcut there.
- **Clipboard read retry.** The literal "Failed to get data from the clipboard (error N: ...)" dialog is wxWidgets' own C++ `wxClipboard::GetData` error (`wxLogSysError`, not a Python exception QUILL's own `try`/`except` could catch), surfaced on the first transient `CLIPBRD_E_CANT_OPEN` contention with another process/AT holding the clipboard. `quill/ui/clipboard_retry.py` (`with_clipboard_read_retry`/`read_clipboard_text`) retries up to 10 attempts, 20ms apart, suppressing the dialog via `wx.LogNull()` on every attempt but the last; wired into every clipboard-read call site (`magic_paste`, abbreviation expansion, Copy Tray, Power Tools plain-text/HTML paste, Quillins).
- **Four crash-report fixes (#915–#918):** a missing `label` argument on a `_show_modal_dialog` call (Spell Check Language chooser); `_IntellisensePopup.is_visible()` now catches `RuntimeError` from a deleted C/C++ `Frame` (a crash-recovery restart could rebuild `MainFrame` without recreating the popup, leaving a stale reference); and the AI Hub Engines tab's background-install completion callback now tolerates the panel having been closed/destroyed before the install finished.
- **Crash opening the Quillins Manager when PyNaCl is not installed (#919).** PyNaCl is a dev/CI-only dependency (Quillin Hub artifact signing/publishing), never a shipping one, but `quill/tools/signing.py` imported it unconditionally at module level — so simply viewing a Quillin’s details (which checks its signature status) crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError` on every real build. The import is now lazy (`TYPE_CHECKING` + function-local), and `verify_artifact`/`signature_status` — whose own docstrings already promised "fail-closed, never raises" — now catch a missing `nacl` the same way they catch every other verification failure, reporting "PyNaCl is not installed" instead of crashing.
- **Quillin signature verification is now real on shipping builds (#919 follow-up).** The #919 fix stopped the crash but left the feature inert: PyNaCl stayed a `[signing]`/`[dev]` extra no shipping build installed, so the Quillins Manager's "Signature: verified/unsigned" lines never ran for end users — only the "PyNaCl is not installed" fallback did. PyNaCl is now a runtime dependency (the `[ui]` extra, mirrored in `requirements.txt` and the macOS py2app `includes`), so `verify_artifact`/`signature_status` run on every install. The graceful missing-nacl path in `quill/tools/signing.py` stays as defense in depth. A regression guard (`test_pynacl_is_bundled_in_the_ui_extra_for_quillin_signature_verification`) locks PyNaCl into the bundled `[ui]` set so it can't silently revert to dev-only.
- **The Report a Bug token is mandatory on every build (#919, hardened).** The bundled issues-only GitHub token (`quill/_feedback_token.py`, baked from `QUILL_FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN` by `tools/generate_feedback_token.py`) is what lets the in-app bug reporter file straight to the issue tracker instead of dead-ending. An earlier beta shipped it empty on Windows (only macOS baked it), so upgrades showed "no token"; a first fix made a missing token hard-fail the *release* build, but still left an `--allow-missing-feedback-token` escape hatch so an ad-hoc local or beta build could silently ship tokenless. The token is now required on **every** build, Windows and macOS, with no opt-out: `scripts/build_windows_distribution.py` always passes `--require-token` to the generator and `_assert_bundled_token_nonempty` asserts the file that actually lands in the bundled `quill/` package is non-empty (the exact "upgraded and got No token" symptom, locked out); `scripts/build_macos.sh` always runs the generator with `--require-token`. The `--require-feedback-token` flag is kept as an accepted no-op so the release workflow is unchanged. Regression guards in `tests/unit/scripts/test_build_windows_distribution.py` (`test_build_guard_refuses_an_empty_token`, `test_build_guard_refuses_a_missing_token_file`, `test_build_guard_accepts_a_real_token`) lock the guard.

#### API-key onboarding for env-var-authenticated harnesses

`openai_agents` and `claude_agent_sdk` both declare `requires_api_key=True` but, unlike GitHub Copilot's OAuth device flow, authenticate by reading `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` directly from the process environment with no QUILL-specific hook — so a successfully installed harness previously had no in-app way to add a key at all. `quill/core/ai/harness_credentials.py` bridges this the same way `copilot_auth.py` bridges GitHub tokens: the key is persisted in QUILL's existing per-provider secure store (`assistant_ai.save_provider_api_key`, keyed by `pack_id`) and exported to the environment immediately so the SDK picks it up without a restart; `apply_all_stored_keys()` runs at startup so a key saved in an earlier session is already in place before anything checks harness availability. `HarnessApiKeyDialog` (`quill/ui/harness_api_key_dialog.py`, modeled on `CopilotOnboardingDialog` but simpler — one pasted key, no OAuth) is reached from the AI Hub Engines tab's **Set Up** action once a harness is installed.

### 5.25b Watch Folder automation

Quill provides an optional watch-folder workflow under `Tools -> Watch Folder` for low-friction
document intake. Users can point Quill at one or more folders, drop supported files into them, and have Quill
process those files automatically without leaving the editor.

The original single-folder watcher has been replaced by a multi-profile **Watch Service** built on the wx-free
`quill.core.watch_service` facade. Each watch profile is an independent rule set with its own watched folder,
recursion and polling behaviour, file filters, and action (for example: open in editor, or run an intake
action). Profiles are stored through `watch_profile_store` and validated against a schema, so an invalid or
partial profile can never start a worker.

- Multiple named watch profiles can be configured and enabled or disabled independently.
- Supported drop formats follow Quill's core supported file-extension set, optionally narrowed per profile.
- Polling, subfolder recursion, and the per-profile action are configurable from Watch Folder Settings.
- A dedicated, fully accessible **Watch Queue Monitor** (`Watch` menu) lists queued, in-progress, completed,
  and failed items so users can track and retry automation without a visual dashboard.
- Watch work runs off the UI thread through `watch_worker`/`watch_queue`; results marshal back through
  `wx.CallAfter` and surface in the status/notification channel. No silent failures.
- Watch-folder automation is configured from Preferences (Watch Folder Automation). A first-run wizard onboarding step for it is planned (see docs/planning.md).
- A watch profile can use the same `BatchPlan` shape from `### 5.3a.1` when its action is "convert to QUILL" or "convert from QUILL" - the Watch Service reuses `quill.core.batch_convert.run_batch` so a folder of dropped `.docx` files becomes a folder of opened Markdown tabs without a separate Batch Conversion wizard run. The action field on the watch profile chooses between the inline batch path and the open-in-editor path; both run on the background task pool.

### 5.25c Offline speech and transcription

Quill's on-device speech engine (whisper.cpp by default) ships under `Tools -> Speech`
and runs entirely on the user's machine. The deferred, locked-off `core.bw_whisperer`
brand surface (superseded by this flat menu) is tracked in the locked-features register
in [`roadmap.md`](../../planning/roadmap.md) §2; this section describes only what ships today.

**On-demand engine acquisition (release-asset).** The whisper.cpp engine is **not
bundled** (see §5.25f, [Recommended host and redistribution rules](#acquisition-host-model)):
it downloads on demand from QUILL's verified
release asset to `%APPDATA%\Quill\speech-engine`, which the runtime searches. The
**first time offline dictation/transcription is used without it, QUILL offers the
download in-flow** (the dictation pre-flight prompts), and it is also at
`Tools -> Speech -> Download Offline Speech Engine...`. Acquisition is
`quill/core/release_assets.py` (wx-free): a **pinned**, **SHA-256-verified** download
from QUILL's controlled GitHub release asset (`assets-v1`), HTTPS-only, with
retry/resumable download, atomic verified install, and a clean error on failure;
gated by an explicit user action, the GATE-9 network-egress audit, and Safe Mode.
**Upgraders keep their existing `{app}\tools\speech\whispercpp` copy** (Inno never
removes it; `[InstallDelete]` does not touch it; the resolver still checks it), so
upgrades never lose offline speech. Only components QUILL is licensed to redistribute
are hosted this way (whisper.cpp is MIT, Kokoro Apache-2.0); license-unclear engines
are not re-hosted, and ffmpeg is never re-hosted (it stays user-installed).

**Kokoro voices unbundled (proof of concept).** The ~120 MB Kokoro neural voices are
no longer shipped in the installer; they download on demand through the same
`release_assets` path (pinned `kokoro-models.zip` on `assets-v1`, SHA-256-verified) to
`%APPDATA%\Quill\kokoro-models`, which the runtime prefers. This shrinks the base
installer and proves release-asset hosting for a model component. **Upgraders are
protected automatically:** Inno only overlays new `[Files]` and never removes old
ones, `[InstallDelete]` does not touch `kokoro-models`, and runtime resolution still
checks `{app}\kokoro-models` (`read_aloud._bundled_kokoro_model_dir`) — so a user
upgrading from a release that bundled Kokoro keeps their copy with nothing to
re-download. Kokoro is in the "safe to unbundle" class (other read-aloud voices
remain available offline if the download has not happened). **The kokoro-onnx
*package* is now also unbundled** (0.9.0 Beta 2): it was still shipped in the base
runtime (dragging in onnxruntime, phonemizer, espeakng-loader, and babel) even
though the models were on-demand. It now installs on first use via
`install_kokoro_onnx()` into an engine-pack that `activate_engine_packs()` puts on
`sys.path`, trimming the installer ~23 MB. Lesson banked (#881): the build's
runtime-prune step must not drop `babel` — kokoro-onnx imports `babel.numbers`
transitively, so pruning it broke Kokoro's onnx path on a clean build; the on-demand
install now pulls babel with the rest of the tree.

**DECtalk and eSpeak NG unbundled.** The classic DECtalk runtime (~2 MB) and the
eSpeak NG engine with its voice data (~40 MB) are no longer shipped in the
installer; each downloads on demand from `assets-v1` (DECtalk via
`quill/core/dectalk_runtime.py`, pinned `vs2022.zip`, SHA-256-verified, to
`%APPDATA%\Quill\speech\dectalk`; eSpeak via `quill/core/speech/espeak_install.py`,
pinned `espeak-ng.msi`, SHA-256-verified and extracted admin-free with `msiexec /a`,
to `%APPDATA%\Quill\speech\espeak-ng`) — both folders the resolver already searches.
The two MSI/zip assets are QUILL-hosted, byte-identical re-publishes of the upstream
releases (matching the bundled-build pins) so the on-demand path has one controlled,
verified acquisition point. Windows' built-in **SAPI 5** voices remain the
always-present offline floor while a download has not happened, so the user is never
left without a voice. **Upgraders keep any existing `{app}\tools\speech\dectalk` /
`espeak-ng` copy** (Inno never removes it; `[InstallDelete]` does not touch it; the
resolver still checks it). eSpeak NG is GPLv3 and DECtalk is BSD-licensed; both are
already covered by QUILL's redistribution/compliance notices, so re-hosting carries
the same terms as bundling did.

**Cloud providers ship as Quillins, not core.** Per the consolidation plan (#669), the cloud
provider matrix is delivered as extensions rather than baked into core. A Quillin declares a
provider through the **`transcription_providers`** manifest contribution; QUILL's host implements
it. The contract is host-mediated and least-privilege: the Quillin ships no code and requests no
`net` capability — it only declares the provider (`id`, `display_name`, a host-vetted `kind`,
optional `credential` label and `max_file_mb`). The host performs the upload through its existing
network-egress-audited transcription path, so the sandbox never receives audio bytes or the API
key, and a manifest can never target an arbitrary endpoint (only known `kind`s are accepted).
Host adapters implement the `SpeechToTextProvider` ABC and register into the speech registry, so a
contributed provider appears in Manage Speech Models and the transcribe pickers. Providers are
tagged network-backed and are excluded from the offline paths (the offline Watch Folder transcribe
action only ever uses on-device engines); they are unavailable in Safe Mode or without a configured
key. Implementation: `quill/core/speech/quillin_providers.py`, the `transcription_providers`
model/validation/schema in `quill/core/quillins/`, and the bundled reference Quillin
`openai-whisper-transcription`. Developer reference: `docs/quillins/quillins.md` §"Transcription
providers".

### 5.25f AI footprint, on-demand acquisition, and optimization

QUILL's guiding aim is to be **as capable as possible on whatever hardware the user
has**, while keeping its on-disk and in-memory footprint small — *fitting more
capability onto modest, CPU-only machines*, never trimming features off the low end.
This section is the durable reference for that stance and for the acquisition model
every on-demand component obeys. It absorbs the former standalone footprint/optimization
plan. The wx-free cores for the runtime-memory policy (`quill/core/model_lifecycle.py`),
the machine-aware upgrade advisor (`quill/core/model_upgrade.py`), the consent-safe
cloud↔local fallback (`quill/core/ai/fallback.py`), and the in-app measurement sampler
(`quill/core/footprint_sampler.py`) have landed with unit tests, along with two accessible
settings (**Low-resource mode** and **Unload idle models after…**) and a build-only Babel
prune. Their live wiring into the running app, and the build/hardware-gated measurements and
installer-size wins, are tracked in [`roadmap.md`](../../planning/roadmap.md) §1.2.

**Design principles (firm constraints).**

- **Capable on any hardware.** The full feature set runs on a modest, CPU-only Windows
  machine with limited RAM. Optimization exists to *extend* capability downward to
  low-end hardware, never to disable features on it.
- **AI and speech available wherever feasible.** Prefer enabling AI and speech —
  on-device when it fits, cloud when the user opts in — over gating them behind
  hardware. A weaker machine gets a smaller/slower model, not "no feature."
- **No GPU requirement, ever.** The default, fully-supported path is **CPU-only**.
  Nothing may require a discrete GPU or degrade when one is absent.
- **GPU is a welcome bonus when present.** If a usable GPU is detected, engines may
  auto-accelerate (e.g. Faster Whisper's CUDA float16 path) — automatically and
  optionally, never as a precondition and never something the user must configure.

**Already optimized on the model side.** QUILL ships quantized models throughout
(Faster Whisper CTranslate2 **int8 on CPU** / float16 on CUDA; Kokoro **int8 ONNX**;
whisper.cpp GGML-quantized; local LLMs as GGUF Q4/Q5 via Ollama / `llama_cpp_backend`),
with **lazy, optional loading** (heavy ML imports deferred via `importlib.util.find_spec`,
imported only on use), **warm/unload lifecycle** primitives on the speech and Kokoro
providers, optional install components with on-demand downloads, and **machine-aware
recommendations** that size suggestions to the user's RAM / GPU / disk. So the remaining
wins are in packaging, runtime memory, and routing — not in re-quantizing models.

<a id="reliable-acquisition-model"></a>**Reliable acquisition model.** Anything QUILL
does not bundle becomes something it must fetch dependably, possibly years later when an
upstream URL may have moved. Every on-demand asset obeys all of the following (the
`quill/core/release_assets.py`, `ai/model_manager._download`, and
`scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py` paths encode this):

1. **Pinned, versioned source + SHA-256.** Every asset has a pinned URL (or pinned
   release tag/commit) and a recorded SHA-256; bytes are verified before use, and a
   moving ref (`HEAD`/`latest`/`main`) is refused for the pinned path.
2. **GATE-9 / no-silent-network.** Each download call site has a reviewed entry in
   `network_egress_audit.py` and a visible, consented surface (progress dialog / explicit
   action). No silent fetches; Safe Mode disables all of it.
3. **Atomic + verified install.** Download to a temp path, verify the SHA, then
   atomically place it (temp + replace) so a partial/failed download never leaves a
   half-installed asset that looks present.
4. **Retry + resumability.** Bounded retry with backoff and resumable (HTTP Range) download
   so a dropped connection on a large asset does not force a full restart.
5. **Source resilience.** Pin to a stable host and record a mirror/fallback URL where
   licensing allows, so a single upstream outage cannot strand a feature. The verified
   SHA makes any mirror safe to trust.
6. **Graceful offline / failure UX.** On no-network, timeout, 404, checksum mismatch,
   rate-limit, or low disk (`enough_disk_for`), surface a clear, screen-reader-friendly
   message and leave the app fully usable for everything else. Never crash, never silently
   degrade.
7. **Integrity over time.** A periodic/CI acquisition healthcheck resolves every pinned
   URL and re-checks reachability + checksum, so a dead upstream is caught by us, not by a
   user offline at the worst moment.
8. **Already-present is smart, not silent.** An installed component is not re-downloaded;
   QUILL offers to **replace** it, and declining keeps the existing copy.
9. **Newer-version awareness.** Each asset records its upstream `version`; a lightweight
   check compares installed vs. pinned manifest and **offers** a newer verified version —
   never auto-replacing a working component.

<a id="acquisition-host-model"></a>**Recommended host and redistribution rules.** The
strongest way to satisfy source resilience is to host redistributable assets **ourselves**
as GitHub Release assets on a Community-Access repo (the pinned `assets-v1` tag). This
re-points the runtime on-demand path at a release we control, with stable
`…/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>` direct-download URLs (not the rate-limited releases
API), each SHA-256-pinned and honouring HTTP Range for resumability. Hard constraints:

- **License/redistribution gate (per asset).** Re-host only what we are licensed to
  redistribute. whisper.cpp (MIT), Kokoro (Apache-2.0), and Piper are fine; **eSpeak NG
  is GPLv3** (allowed with the source-offer obligation already in the compliance notices);
  **DECtalk is BSD**. All four are re-hosted on `assets-v1` as byte-identical re-publishes
  of the upstream binaries. **ffmpeg is explicitly excluded** — QUILL never bundles or
  re-hosts it (see `quill/core/speech/ffmpeg.py`); it stays user-installed. Every re-hosted
  asset needs a third-party-notices entry.
- **2 GB per-asset limit.** GitHub caps a single release asset at 2 GB, so multi-GB assets
  — speech `large-v3` (~3.1 GB) and the GGUF LLMs (`phi-4-mini` ~2.5 GB) — stay on their
  canonical Hugging Face hosts, which the code already uses.
- **Verify regardless of host.** The SHA-256 check stays even for assets we control; it
  defends against a replaced/corrupted asset and lets any mirror be trusted.

**The download experience is accessible by contract.** Each on-demand download runs behind
an accessible, **cancelable** progress dialog (`AIProgressDialog`) with spoken milestones;
focus is owned and returns to the feature that needed the component. Downloads are reachable
where the user already is (the feature surface, a Help-menu "Download optional components…"
entry, and an optional first-run Setup-Wizard offer), never block the UI thread, are
disabled by Safe Mode, and present one consistent surface across OCR, Scribe, speech, and
voices (the AI Hub Services framework).

**The Download Optional Components hub is a first-class place (design spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-download-components-experience-design.md`).** The wx-free
status model (`quill/core/optional_components.py`) sorts components by importance (Pandoc and
the braille pack first) and covers every component QUILL can fetch — a completeness guard test
asserts each hosted `release_assets` component is catalogued (Vosk and libmpv are hosted
assets folded into other rows rather than standalone ones — see below — and are explicitly
exempted from that guard), and Piper and Node.js (missing before) are now listed. The dialog
(`quill/ui/optional_components_dialog.py`) shows a size on every row and a rich, read-only
description of the focused component (`describe_component`), and gathers the list on a worker
thread so it opens instantly rather than stalling on tool version probes. For an installed
component it offers **Test** — a per-component self-test that maintains confidence: voice
engines speak a sample (the phrase lives in `scripts/phrase.txt`), offline STT engines run a
SAPI→transcribe→compare loop and report what they heard (`verify_component`), and tools report
their version — and **Remove** (`removable_path`/`remove_component`), which deletes only
QUILL-downloaded copies **under the active data dir** (the portable data folder in portable
mode; never a system tool, a bundled `{app}` copy, or anything outside it) and closes the loop
by resetting the active Read Aloud engine to SAPI 5 when the removed engine was in use. Any
download or self-test failure is captured (`DownloadFailure`, plus the pip error logged to
`quill.log`) and offered as a one-click bug report through the diagnostics bundle. The
scattered startup braille-pack prompt now routes into this hub, preselected on the braille
pack with a guiding popup, rather than running its own installer.

**Rows were folded together for a flatter, less repetitive list (0.9.0 Beta 2, #847).**
Vosk (a third offline dictation engine, alongside whisper.cpp and Faster Whisper) no longer has
its own row — the hub's single **"Dictation (offline speech)"** row (renamed from "Offline speech
engine (whisper.cpp)" so it names the outcome, not the implementation) opens a guided picker to
choose an engine and a model together (`quill/core/speech/guided_setup.py`,
`quill/ui/guided_speech_dialog.py`); Vosk is simply a third `OfflineSpeechEngineOption` there,
installed via the same `_ensure_offline_engine`/`install_vosk` path as the other two. Separately,
FFmpeg (compressed-audio export), mpv playback, and MP3 chapter markers — three export/playback
extras — are now one row, **"Audio: export, playback & chapters"** (`_audio_extras_installed`,
`download_audio_extras`; FFmpeg is fetched on demand at export time via `download_ffmpeg`, not as
part of the row's own download), so there is one place for audio extras instead of three; the
standalone FFmpeg row is gone. Node.js moved to the bottom of the list as the least-used extra
(`priority=110`).

**The dictation setup is a guided Engine→Model→Test→Default journey (0.9.0 Beta 2).** A wx-free
brain, `guided_setup.dictation_setup_status()` (unit-tested), computes the three-step state
(install an engine → download a model → test and set default) for the selected engine, and the
Manage Speech Models panel (`quill/ui/speech_setup_dialog.py`) renders it as a "you are here / do
this next" banner, auto-selects the recommended model, and adds an inline **Test dictation**
button. The panel now opens on the user's *saved* engine even when it is not yet ready
(`MainFrame._configured_speech_provider`, resolved from the shared registry so the engine radio
matches by identity), instead of the availability-fallback default that made it always reopen on
whisper.cpp. The self-test (`optional_components.verify_component` → `_verify_stt`) targets the
selected provider (`transcribe.transcribe_audio_file(provider_id=…)` /
`provider_has_installed_model`) so it proves the exact engine, covers all three offline engines
(whisper.cpp, Faster Whisper, Vosk), and logs its OK/FAILED outcome so failures reach the
diagnostics bundle rather than living only in the on-screen dialog. Testing an engine with no
model installed still routes to the guided picker (`open_guided_offline_speech`); a successful
Test also persists the engine as the dictation default, so Test doubles as "use this engine."

**Size / RAM reference (current observations, to be re-baselined by the footprint report).**
`scripts/footprint_report.py` emits the diffable size/machine baseline under
`docs/planning/footprint/`. Offline speech models (download size; Faster Whisper's on-disk
int8 is smaller), with the RAM tier `service.required_ram_gb` maps each to:

| Model | Download | Accuracy | Speed | Est. RAM tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tiny | 75 MB | low | fast | ~2 GB |
| base | 145 MB | low | fast | ~2 GB |
| small | 465 MB | medium | medium/fast | ~4 GB |
| medium | 1500 MB | high | slow | ~6 GB |
| large-v3 | 3100 MB | highest | slow | ~8 GB |

Speech recommender (`service.recommend_model_id`) by total RAM: <3 GB → tiny; <6 → base;
<12 → small; <16 → medium; ≥16 → medium (or large-v3 with a GPU). On-device LLM (GGUF
Q4_K_M, `ai/model_manager.py`; auto-downloaded + SHA-256-verified): **Llama 3.2 1B Instruct**
~0.8 GB (default under 8 GB RAM), **Phi-4-mini Instruct** ~2.5 GB (8 GB+). The Windows
installer (0.8.1 local build) is ≈ 245 MB, dominated by the embedded CPython 3.13 runtime +
wheels; the embeddable stdlib is already lean (`python313.zip` 3.6 MB; `tkinter`, `test`,
`idlelib`, `ensurepip`, `lib2to3`, `distutils` all absent), so the footprint lever is large
*data inside wheels* (spell-check dictionaries, CLDR locale data — Babel is now pruned as
build-only) and optional engines that qualify for on-demand, not stdlib modules. The largest
optional engine, **Vosk** (~51 MB `libvosk` wheel), is no longer bundled: it installs on demand
via `quill/core/speech/engine_install.install_vosk` (**Tools → Speech → Download Vosk**),
preferring QUILL's own pinned, SHA-256-verified wheel on the `assets-v1` release and falling
back to PyPI. No offline speech engine ships in the installer now — the tiny default whisper.cpp
(~8 MB) is itself fetched on demand — so the base download stays small while capability is a
one-time verified fetch away.

### 5.25d Batch Document-to-Speech, pronunciation, and SSML (shipped)

QUILL converts whole folders of documents to speech audio and gives the user fine control over how that audio sounds. This section records the shipped behavior; the original design plan and project-format spec were retired to git history once delivered (their remaining follow-ups are tracked in [`roadmap.md`](../../planning/roadmap.md) §1.2). All synthesis logic is wx-free and headless-testable; the UI wraps it on the background task pool.

**QUILL Audio Studio (`Tools → Speech → Audio Studio…`).** A guided, journey-aware wizard (it replaced the single-page Batch Export to Speech Audio dialog at full option parity; the `tools.speech_batch_export` command id is unchanged so keymaps and menu customizations keep working). The start page picks a journey — *narrate documents* or *combine audio files into one chaptered audiobook* — and the following pages adapt: What should I read? (folder, types, filters) → Who should read it? (engine, voice + preview, pace, round-robin rotation, translated editions) → How should chapters work? (mode, spoken headings, the transition sounder + volume, article/sentence/tail gaps) → Output and diagnostics (format, existing-file policy, ACX loudness, dry run, spoken-text sidecars, temp folder) → the book page → a plain-sentence summary. Back/Next/Start follow the standard wizard keyboard contract, every step is announced ("Step 2 of 7: What should I read?"), and **Skip to summary** fast-forwards a returning user whose project profile already fills every page. `AudioStudioWizard` (`quill/ui/audio_studio/`) collects the same `BatchSpeechRequest` the classic dialog produced, so the tested runner and profile persistence are unchanged. The run reports per-file progress and is cancelable; the conversion uses the same shared pipeline as live Read Aloud (normalize → pronounce → polish → synthesize), so audition matches output.

- **Pipeline modules.** `quill/core/speech/batch_export.py` (per-file pipeline), `batch_discovery.py` (folder scan + filters), `batch_manifest.py` (run report), `chapters.py` / `chapter_assemble.py` (MP3 ID3v2.3 CHAP/CTOC chapter markers + heading-aware assembly with inter-article/sentence pauses, optional transition earcon, spoken headings, anti-clipping tail pad), `ffmpeg.py` (encode to compressed formats, metadata, WAV conform), and `document_speech.py`.
- **Chapterization options.** **MP3** (ID3 chapter markers) or **M4B audiobook** (native MP4 chapter atoms via ffmpeg FFMETADATA) output; over-long sections auto-chunk on safe sentence/word boundaries (`tts_chunk`) so no synthesis call exceeds the engine timeout; the run reports each document's chapter count. The transition earcon defaults to the bundled **page-turn cue** (`quill/assets/audio/page_turn.wav`); a configured `batch_speech_chapter_sound_id` overrides it from the active sound pack (`batch_speech_runner._resolve_chapter_sound_path`). Any chosen or default sound is **conformed** to the section PCM format (resample / channel-mix / width via `earcon.conform_wav_frames`) so it splices cleanly regardless of its own format — the synthesized chime is only a last-resort fallback. A **Chapter mode** selects one chaptered file or **Separate file per article** (`document_speech.synthesize_document_to_separate_files`, one `NNN - <heading>` file per section). A **Dry run** writes a `<doc>.preview.txt` of the exact post-pipeline spoken text (with the substitution count) for proofing without synthesizing. **Combine empty headings** (opt-in) folds bodyless headings into the next article and joins their titles (`text_polish.combine_heading_only_sections`, the ACB rule). **Normalize loudness** (opt-in) runs each output through a **two-pass `loudnorm`** (`loudness.normalize_wav_loudness`: measure with `print_format=json`, then apply with the measured values, `linear=true`) on the assembled WAV before encoding, so MP3/M4B chapter markers and timing survive — the ChapterForge/ACB method, matching the audiobook builder's ACX option. **Round-robin voices** voices each section by the next entry in a user-ordered voice list (`assemble_chaptered_audio(..., synthesizers=…)`, section *i* → voice *i mod N*); the rotation uses voices of the selected engine so all sections share one PCM format. The batch dialog builds the voice list with the accessible add-from-combobox + reorderable-ListBox pattern (no checkboxes in lists). Both options persist in `ChapterProfile` (`.quill/speech-project.json`).
- **Discovery.** Extension set, recursion, semicolon/comma-separated **include/exclude globs** (matched against name and relative path), and a **max-file-size** cap.
- **Output.** `wav` (always available) plus `mp3`/`m4a`/`m4b`/`opus`/`flac`/`ogg` via `ffmpeg`, falling back to WAV with a per-file note when `ffmpeg` is absent; selectable MP3 VBR quality; optional uniform WAV sample-rate/channel conform; **audiobook metadata** (album, author/narrator, genre, year; per-file title and track derived from heading/index).
- **Layout and resume.** Existing-file policy `skip`/`overwrite`/`rename`; mirror or `flatten`; `filename_template` (`{stem}`/`{index}`/`{index0}`/`{total}`); optional `manifest.json`/`.csv`.
- **Reliability and throughput.** Per-file `retry`, `stop_on_error`, and `max_workers` parallelism — clamped to one worker for the single-apartment engines (SAPI 5, Kokoro). Per-engine shaping is exposed for eSpeak (pitch, word gap) and Piper (length/noise scales).
- **Project profile.** A folder remembers its whole speech setup in `<folder>/.quill/speech-project.json` (schema `quill/core/schemas/speech_project.json`): synthesizer, discovery, output, chapters, normalization, pronunciation, metadata, and execution. `project_profile.to_batch_options` drives the pipeline straight from a project file. The batch dialog **applies the profile on open** and **auto-remembers choices on Start** (`batch_speech_runner._apply_project_profile` / `_save_project_profile`), with precedence this-run > project profile > global defaults.
- **Translated audio export (shipped — local *and* cloud voices).** Synthesizes a document in additional languages: the text is translated per section, then narrated with a voice for that language, written as `<doc> (<Language>).<ext>`. Two surfaces: the **batch** "Also export in other languages" picker (folder) and a **single-document** action `Tools → Speech → Export to Translated Speech Audio` (`quill/ui/translated_speech_export_dialog.py` + `translated_speech_runner.py`, reusing the batch `_export_translations` core). Translation rides QUILL's AI gateway (**any configured AI provider**) or **LibreTranslate**, with bounded-backoff retries that **halt a language on persistent failure** and a translation cache (`speech/translate_sections.py`). Voices come from the per-language model (`speech/voice_languages.py`) **local-first** — eSpeak NG (universal offline, with dialects), installed SAPI 5 matched by LCID — then the **premium cloud tier** (OpenAI / Gemini / ElevenLabs), which synthesizes through `cloud_tts` and is conformed to WAV via ffmpeg so chapter splicing holds (`document_speech.make_synthesizer` cloud branch; `SynthesisSpec.api_key`/`model`). A cloud target with no configured key is skipped with a status note. Pronunciation dictionaries are language-scoped (`PronunciationDictionary.language`); the full chaptered treatment applies per language. *Remaining 2.0 nicety:* persisting the chosen targets in the project profile.
- **Cost surfacing (shipped).** A translated cloud run can meter twice (translate + synthesize), so `speech/cost_estimate.py` produces an honest **combined estimate** — TTS priced precisely per provider/model via `cloud_tts`; translation free for LibreTranslate or a local AI model and estimated from a blended per-character rate for a paid cloud AI — surfaced for confirmation before any metered run (`batch_speech_runner.confirm_cloud_cost`). Local-only runs are never interrupted.
- **Voice-failure blacklist (shipped).** A voice that fails synthesis is recorded and **skipped on later runs** (`speech/voice_blacklist.py`, persisted atomically in the app data dir): `document_speech` drops blacklisted ids from the round-robin rotation and wraps each synthesizer to record a failure (then re-raise, so the current run is unchanged); the runners load the blacklist once and save it after the run.
- **Subprocess hardening.** The Piper and eSpeak-NG file-synthesis subprocesses launch with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (no console flash between files) and the eSpeak-NG synthesis carries a timeout that raises a clean `ReadAloudUnavailableError` rather than stalling the run.

**Pronunciation dictionaries (`Tools → Speech → Manage Pronunciations…`).** Ordered substitution rules (literal or regex, optional case sensitivity, per-engine scope) stored in global (app-data) and project (`<folder>/.quill/pronunciation/`) dictionaries (`quill/core/speech/pronunciation.py`, schema `pronunciation.json`). Applied as a silent text transform before synthesis in **both** batch and live Read Aloud, so a correction is heard everywhere; the manager previews entries with live Read-Aloud audio. A bundled starter dictionary ships common terms.

**TTS text normalization.** `quill/core/speech/text_normalize.py` deterministically cleans typography (quotes, dashes, ellipses, invisibles, ligatures, bullets, symbols, fractions, emoji) and speaks structured tokens — phone numbers, emails, URLs — clearly (announce / speak / speak-then-repeat, with a long-URL threshold). It also speaks **publication shorthand** (`Vol.`→"Volume", `No.`→"Number") and **resolution-style numbers** (`2025-02`→"2025 dash 2"), both on by default and opt-out (ACB pipeline learnings). Opt-in via the `tts_normalization` setting and carried per project.

**SSML.** An **SSML Builder** dialog composes `<speak>` markup (emphasis, `<break>`, say-as, phoneme, prosody) from accessible controls with a source preview. Read Aloud renders SSML natively on SAPI 5 and eSpeak-NG (markup mode), passing utterances through intact (no punctuation verbalization that would corrupt the markup).

### 5.25e Build Audiobook from Folder — ChapterForge surface (shipped)

The ChapterForge-aligned "folder of audio → one chaptered master" feature (design
source: the sibling ChapterForge project; only the surfaces that fit QUILL's
audiobook vision are ported). Audiobook building is folded into the **Audio
Studio** (`Tools → Speech → Audio Studio…`) — the *combine audio files* journey
goes straight to it, and in the *narrate documents* journey the book page's
**Assemble the results into one audiobook**
reveals the book tags (title/author/narrator/genre/year), a cover-image picker, the
book format, and a save-as path. After the documents are synthesized (one chapter
per document), the produced — plus any pre-recorded — audio in the folder is combined
into a single chaptered **MP3** (ID3 CHAP/CTOC) or **M4B** (native MP4 chapter atoms)
master. Implementation: wx-free `quill/core/speech/audiobook.py` — folder scan +
natural sort, `title_from_filename` (strips a leading track prefix), `find_cover`
(preferred-name image discovery), `probe_duration_ms` (ffprobe), and the ffmpeg
concat-demuxer build (chapters from `chapters.compute_chapters`, tags + cover from
FFMETADATA / attached picture; MP3 chapters via mutagen). The book's tags and an
auto-detected cover are written, and the build runs on the background task pool. (The
former standalone `audiobook_builder_dialog.py` was retired into this dialog so the
two near-identical surfaces share one accessible path.)

- **Run diagnostics and progress.** The batch dialog also exposes a **temporary
  files folder** (each run gets a `quill-batch-<timestamp>` scratch subfolder) and a
  **Save the text sent to speech** option (writes a `<doc>.spoken.txt` sidecar of the
  exact normalized/pronounced/polished text). A timestamped diagnostic log is opened
  in the output folder *before* conversion starts (`quill/core/speech/conversion_log.py`)
  and records discovery, per-document progress/timings, skips, errors, and the book
  build. Progress is shown in a focused, screen-reader-announced `AIProgressDialog`
  (percentage = words processed / total words) that can be minimized to the status bar.
- **Chapter granularity and review.** In the consolidated flow each document (or
  each pre-recorded file) becomes one chapter, titled from its heading/filename.
  Ticking **Review chapters before building** (and always, for a folder of
  pre-recorded audio) opens `audiobook_chapter_editor_dialog.py` after synthesis —
  the rename/reorder/merge editor from the old standalone builder — whose edited
  plan flows through `audiobook.chapters_from_plan` (`AudiobookChapter.extra_paths`
  carries merged files). The runner shows it by marshalling the modal to the UI
  thread and blocking the background worker until the user closes it.
- **Automation + listening extras (shipped).** `quill/core/watch_audiobook.py` registers the `build_audiobook` watch action (WATCH-10) in the default registry: an arriving audio file rebuilds its folder's `<folder> - Master.<fmt>`; a master newer than the trigger file skips, so dropped batches coalesce to one build. **Library mode** (`library_mode` request field, combine-audio journey): the runner builds one unattended book per subfolder (title = folder name, review editor suppressed, per-book errors isolated). Workbench **Split into files...** cuts the open master into per-chapter files via `audio_edit.split_into_files` (podcast-episode mode). Player extras: `listening_positions.py` (app-data store keyed by path+size; the Workbench resumes where the user stopped and records on close), a pitch-preserving **playback speed** choice (engine `set_rate`, WMP `SetPlaybackRate`), and **Where am I?** — a spoken glance of chapter n-of-m, elapsed/left in chapter, and position/remaining in the book.
- **Publishing (shipped).** `quill/core/publish/`: `rss.py` (RSS 2.0 + iTunes + Podcasting 2.0 feed generation, pure XML, chapters linked to the `…chapters.json` sidecar; local file write only), `destinations.py` (saved SFTP destinations, atomic JSON, **no secrets on disk** — passwords under `quill:publish:sftp:<name>` in the Credential Manager), `sftp_publish.py` (streams the book + companions via `core/ssh/client.connect`, so SEC-9 host-key policy holds), and `auphonic.py` (compact client for the user's own account: presets, `account_info` username/credits, multipart upload + start via the simple API — `preset_uuid` honored — status poll, result download; token under `quill:publish:auphonic`; single reviewed egress site; the publish dialog's "Check account and load presets" fills an accessible preset picker and the send confirmation names the preset and credit balance; the token is also managed in AI Hub > Services beside the other service keys; OAuth was considered and deliberately deferred — it needs a registered Auphonic client app, and the token flow with vault storage meets the same no-secrets-on-disk bar). UI: the Workbench's **Publish...** button opens `publish_dialog.py` (three sections, each an explicit action; Auphonic confirms before upload; dirty chapter edits must be saved first; refused in Safe Mode). Egress-audit entries for the lookup and Auphonic sites. **Transfer progress + cancel:** both transfer paths report real byte progress and honor cancel — `publish_files` threads paramiko's `sftp.put` callback into `on_bytes(name, sent, total)`/`is_cancelled` (raising `PublishCancelled` aborts mid-file; completed files stay), and the Auphonic client streams uploads through a file-like `_ProgressReader` (Content-Length preserved, so `urlopen` remains the single audited egress site) and downloads in blocks, raising `AuphonicCancelled` between blocks. The dialog shows an `AIProgressDialog` with whole-percent throttled updates (never per-block, so the UI queue and screen reader aren't flooded), mirrors progress to the status bar via the frame's background-task progress contract, and announces the exact cancel outcome (SFTP: completed files stay; Auphonic pre-upload-complete: no production started; after: production continues in the account, download skipped).
- **AI chapter titles + voice casting (shipped).** Titles: `quill/core/speech/chapter_titles.py` — `slice_chapter_opening` (pure ffmpeg argv builder + safe_subprocess runner; 16 kHz mono, whisper's shape), transcription via the installed offline model (`transcribe.transcribe_audio_file`; audio never leaves the machine), `propose_chapter_titles` sends only the transcript to the caller's `ask` callable (the frame's `Assistant.ask`, absent in Safe Mode) with a strict short-title prompt, `clean_title` normalizes replies (strips quotes/prefixes/periods, clamps to 8 words) and any per-chapter failure keeps the existing title. Workbench: **Propose AI titles...** — consent dialog states the exact data flow, runs on the background pool, proposals land through the same `_apply` path as silence proposals (review-first, Restore original undoes; Pod-2.0 url/img preserved). Casting: `quill/core/speech/casting.py` — ordered (pattern, voice) rules; `#N` matches section number (1-based), anything else is a case-insensitive fnmatch glob on the heading title; first match wins. `document_speech._build_casting` builds one wrapped synthesizer per cast voice (same engine/pace = one PCM format; pronunciation + failure-recording wrappers; blacklisted voices lose their rules) and `assemble_chaptered_audio` consults the new `synthesizer_for(index, title)` seam before the rotation. `BatchSpeechRequest.casting_rules` rides job files (typed load in `job_file.py`); the wizard's voice page has the pattern + voice + Add-rule editor with a first-match-wins list (engine change clears it, like the rotation). *Remaining nicety:* persisting casting rules in the project profile (schema v3), as with translation targets.
- **Incremental rebuilds (shipped).** `quill/core/speech/synth_cache.py`: `fingerprint(source, settings)` = SHA-256 over the document's bytes + `settings_digest` (canonical sorted JSON of every audio-shaping setting; secrets never enter it); entries persist at `<source folder>/.quill/speech-cache.json` (classified `cache` in the persistence audit — regenerable). The batch runner builds the settings map once per run (engine/voice/rate/speed, format, sounder id+volume, gaps, spoken headings, combine-headings, loudness, round-robin, translations + provider, dictionaries digest) and, per document, reuses the existing output when `can_reuse` matches — counted as skipped with the message "Reused <name> (unchanged since last run)". Gated by `BatchSpeechRequest.reuse_unchanged` (default True; checkbox on the wizard's output step) and active only on the chaptered path with the `overwrite` policy — never on dry runs, auditions, skip, or rename. Any settings change invalidates every fingerprint by construction.
- **Folder feeds (shipped).** `quill/core/publish/feed_folder.py`: a folder of masters run as one show. `FeedFolderConfig` (show title/author/description, media URL base, feed URL, cover URL, per-episode title/description overrides) persists atomically at `<folder>/.quill/feed.json` (same project dir as the speech profile). `discover_masters` orders MP3/M4B/M4A oldest-first (episode 1 = oldest); `folder_feed_items` builds one `FeedItem` per master — title from override else tags (`read_book`) else stem, duration via ffprobe when available (0 otherwise, never fatal), `has_chapters` from the sidecar, per-episode `pubDate` from file mtime (`rss.rfc2822`); `write_folder_feed` regenerates `<folder>/feed.rss` on demand (refuses an empty folder); `write_show_notes` writes an accessible `show-notes.html` (h1 show / h2 episodes / h3 chapters, all text escaped, no scripts). `rss.py` items now carry per-episode `pub_date` and a stable non-permalink `guid`. `Chapter` gained Podcasting 2.0 `url`/`image` fields, emitted as `url`/`img` in `chapters_to_pod2` (omitted when empty) and preserved through Pod-2.0 import in `parse_chapter_text`. UI: `feed_dialog.FolderFeedDialog` (from the Publish dialog's "Folder feed (all episodes)..." button) — show fields, an accessible episode ListBox with apply-to-selected title/description editing, "Write feed.rss now", "Write show notes page"; config saved on every write. All local file IO; uploading stays the SFTP destination's explicit job.
- **Job files, lookup, audition, credits (shipped).** `.quilljob` files (`quill/core/speech/job_file.py`): a portable JSON recipe pinning every `BatchSpeechRequest` field, written atomically, loaded tolerantly (unknown keys ignored, missing keys keep defaults) — saved from the wizard's summary page, loaded from its start page (the wizard reopens pre-filled). **Look up book details** (`quill/core/metadata_lookup.py`): Open Library + MusicBrainz search behind one reviewed egress site (`_http_json`, HTTPS-only, verified TLS, MusicBrainz 1-req/s throttle, consent stated before the first call; entry in `network_egress_audit.py`); results in an accessible single-choice list, chosen match fills the tags. **Cover art:** Open Library matches carry `cover_i` (`LookupResult.cover_id`); after a pick, if the cover field is empty the book page offers a second consented fetch — `fetch_cover` downloads the `-L.jpg` jacket from covers.openlibrary.org (`?default=false` so a missing cover 404s; payloads under 1 KB rejected as placeholders) to `cover.jpg` in the source folder (own reviewed egress entry `metadata_lookup.py::fetch_cover`). **Audition** (`audition` request field): discovery slices to the first document. **Spoken credits** (`book_credits`; `quill/core/speech/credits.py`): opening/closing announcements synthesized with the run's own spec ride as the first/last chapters, best-effort (a credits failure never sinks the book).
- **Chapter Workbench + player (shipped).** The Studio's third journey, **Edit an existing audiobook** (`quill/ui/audio_studio/chapter_workbench.py`): `book_file.py` reads tags/chapters/duration from an existing MP3 (ID3 CHAP/CTOC + text frames via mutagen) or M4B (one ffprobe `-show_format -show_chapters` call); a chapterless file opens as one chapter. The Workbench pairs the chapter list (real times in every row) with the ported ChapterForge **PlayerPanel** (`player_panel.py`) over an engine protocol (`audio_engine.py`, default backend `wx.media.MediaCtrl`/WMP — no new native dependency; **the mpv backend is now implemented**: `mpv_engine.MpvAudioEngine`, a minimal ctypes binding over the libmpv client API — create/initialize/command/get-set property/destroy — with a `wx.Timer` polling `duration`/`eof-reached` so every call and callback stays on the UI thread; `create_engine` prefers it whenever `find_libmpv()` locates `libmpv-2.dll` in `engine-packs/mpv`, beside the executable, or via `QUILL_LIBMPV`, and any mpv failure falls back to wx.media; the DLL is never bundled — it is a pinned assets-v1 component (`ASSETS["libmpv"]`: `libmpv-pack.zip`, stable-anchored — the shinchiro 2025-12-28 weekly, mpv git a58dd8a, the first prebuilt after the v0.41.0 stable tag (upstream publishes no DLL of the exact tag); DLL byte-identical to upstream, SHA-256-pinned, `expect_member="libmpv-2.dll"`; the zip carries GPLv2/GPLv3 texts, mpv's Copyright, and a corresponding-source offer, the same GPL redistribution posture as the liblouis braille pack) surfaced as "mpv player engine" in Help > Download Optional Components (`download_libmpv`, Safe-Mode-blocked, background progress)): Play/Pause, Stop, Previous/Next chapter, Rewind/Forward, spoken position slider, volume, and chapter-crossing announcements. Surgery buttons drive the tested core ops — **Split at playhead**, **Set start to playhead**, Merge, Restore — plus full chapter-list import/export and in-place tag editing. Saving: MP3 **in place** (tag frames only, audio untouched), M4B as a **lossless `-c copy` re-mux** (`save_m4b_book_as`; in-place is refused with a speakable message). Long saves run on the background pool.
- **Chapter power tools (core).** `quill/core/speech/chapter_io.py` imports/exports chapter lists in five formats (Audacity labels, plain timestamps, CUE, Podcasting 2.0 JSON, CSV — import auto-detects, including any CSV with a Title column); `chapters.py` gained the surgery ops (`merge_chapter`, `split_chapter` at a millisecond point, `set_chapter_start` retiming, `clamp_chapters`) with speakable `ChapterEditError` messages; `silence.py` proposes chapters at detected silences (always reviewed, never applied blind) and trims head/tail silence; `audio_edit.py` provides trim/fades/pitch-preserving tempo/split-master-into-chapter-files. All wx-free, strict-typed, and unit-tested (`test_chapter_io.py`, `test_chapter_edits.py`, `test_silence.py`, `test_audio_edit.py`).
- **Pre-flight, estimate, verification, sidecars.** Before a book build the runner logs a **pre-flight stream check** (`preflight_check` names files whose sample rate/channels/codec differ — the build still proceeds; it re-encodes) and a duration/size **estimate**. After the build, `verify_audiobook` **re-reads the master** (ID3 CHAP via mutagen, or M4B chapter atoms via ffprobe) and the summary reports "verified N chapters" or the exact issues. `write_book_sidecars` drops a plain-text **chapter report** and the **Podcasting 2.0 `…chapters.json`** next to every book. The review editor adds **Remove**, **Restore original**, **Import titles...** (all `chapter_io` formats), and **Export titles...**.
- **ACX loudness.** A **Normalize to ACX** option applies an ffmpeg `loudnorm` pass
  (targeting RMS ≈ -20 dB, true-peak -3.1 dB) during the existing re-encoding build,
  so chapters/tags are preserved. After the build the master is measured with
  `volumedetect` and the RMS/peak verdict against ACX's -23…-18 dB / -3 dB window is
  surfaced in the completion status (`quill/core/speech/loudness.py`). FLAC/Opus
  *output* is intentionally not offered — neither carries chapter markers (both stay
  accepted as source files).
- **Deferred to 2.0** (`docs/planning/roadmap.md` §5): direct publishing (#140,
  WordPress/etc., a likely-Quillin integration) and the off-vision ChapterForge
  surfaces — Auphonic post-processing, RSS podcast feeds, SFTP publishing, and
  MusicBrainz/Open Library metadata lookup.

### 5.25a Speech Experience Platform (planned before implementation)

This section defines the next speech milestone as a complete user-facing platform, not a single settings dialog.

Goals:

- Add a first-class **Speech** submenu under the top-level **AI** menu.
- Add two downloadable local speech engines: **Kokoro** and **Piper**.
- Keep **DECtalk** and **eSpeak NG** as bundled local engines for immediate read-aloud availability.
- Provide voice lifecycle UX end to end: discover, download, preview, set preferred, configure, remove.
- Keep installer size lean by making heavier engines download-only while preserving bundled fallback voices.
- Preserve screen-reader-first behavior with predictable announcements, keyboard-first flows, and no surprise network actions.

#### 5.25a.1 AI menu information architecture

The top-level **AI** menu gains a **Speech** submenu with discoverable, keyboard-rebindable commands:

- `AI -> Speech -> Open Speech Center...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Browse Voice Library...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Download Voices...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Preview Current Voice`
- `AI -> Speech -> Set Preferred Voice...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Manage Installed Voices...`
- `AI -> Speech -> Speech Settings...`

The Speech submenu mirrors the command palette and status surfaces, with live keybinding labels exactly like other menu items.

#### 5.25a.2 Engine model and no-bundle policy

Supported engines for this milestone:

- `windows-native` (existing SAPI/OneCore path)
- `dectalk-local` (bundled)
- `espeak-local` (bundled)
- `kokoro-local`
- `piper-local`

Policy:

- DECtalk and eSpeak NG ship with QUILL as local bundled engines.
- No Kokoro or Piper voices are bundled in installer or portable artifacts.
- Voice models are downloaded on demand into `%APPDATA%\Quill\speech\voices\...`.
- Downloads require explicit user action and clear size disclosure before start.
- Speech onboarding includes preview-first guidance and availability announcements before model download.
- **Read Aloud is not English-only (0.9.0).** The voice catalogs are multilingual:
  the Windows engine lists **every installed system voice** in any language; the
  Kokoro catalog includes the Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, and Brazilian
  Portuguese voices already contained in its downloaded model (synthesis passes
  the matching language code per voice); the Piper catalog includes the published
  Italian voices, and its downloader resolves HuggingFace URLs for any
  `lang_REGION-name-quality` id; the eSpeak catalog lists the same non-English
  language set (its data directory ships all languages). Catalogs live in
  `quill/core/voice_catalog.py`. Japanese and Mandarin Kokoro voices are
  deliberately excluded until a proper G2P dependency is added.

#### 5.25a.3 Voice library and download UX

Speech Center includes a searchable voice catalog with filters:

- engine (Windows Native, Kokoro, Piper)
- language and region
- gender/style tags where available
- size band (small/medium/large)
- installed vs not installed

Each voice row exposes:

- voice name and engine
- language and locale
- on-disk size
- install state
- preferred marker

Download behavior:

- resumable downloads with progress and remaining size
- hash verification before activation
- cancellation without corrupt partial state
- failed-download recovery with retry guidance

#### 5.25a.4 Voice preview and A/B comparison

Users can preview voices before and after install.

- Preview text field with stock sample text button
- A/B preview mode for rapid compare between two selected voices
- playback controls: play, stop, replay
- optional "Preview with current speaking settings" toggle

When pre-install preview audio is available from metadata, Quill may fetch a small sample clip on demand. If no preview clip exists, preview requires install and Quill states this clearly.

#### 5.25a.5 Preferred voice and defaults model

Users can star one voice as **Preferred** with one command.

Resolution order for active voice:

1. explicit per-document override (future-compatible field)
2. explicit per-language preferred voice
3. global preferred voice
4. engine fallback voice

Setting a voice as preferred is immediate and announced in plain language.

#### 5.25a.6 Per-voice configuration and platform defaults

Every installed voice has editable settings saved as a profile, and users can mark any profile as default.

Per-voice settings (minimum set):

- rate
- pitch
- volume
- pause style and punctuation pause behavior
- sentence/paragraph chunk size
- output device selection

Platform-aware defaults:

- Windows native voices keep their own defaults
- Kokoro and Piper voices each keep separate defaults
- users can apply "Use as default for this engine" or "Use as global default"

This gives users both broad defaults and precise per-voice control.

#### 5.25a.7 Voice removal and storage hygiene

Manage Installed Voices supports safe removal:

- remove one voice
- remove all voices for selected engine
- show reclaimed disk size before confirmation
- preserve user settings history without dangling references

If the removed voice was preferred, Quill prompts for a replacement or applies deterministic fallback and announces it.

#### 5.25a.8 Speech onboarding flow

First-time speech onboarding starts when the user opens Speech Center with no installed downloadable voices.

Flow:

1. Explain available engines and that voices are optional downloads.
2. Ask preferred language/locale.
3. Recommend starter voices for Kokoro and Piper.
4. Offer quick preview where possible.
5. Download selected voices.
6. Ask user to mark preferred voice.
7. Offer one-click "Make these settings my default".

The onboarding flow can be re-run via `Help -> Run Onboarding Again` and `AI -> Speech -> Open Speech Center...`.

#### 5.25a.9 Accessibility and safety requirements

- Every Speech Center control is a stock wx control with correct label, role, and state.
- Progress updates are announced without flooding speech output.
- No auto-downloads or silent background network actions.
- All destructive actions (remove voice, reset defaults) require confirmation.
- All errors are plain-language and actionable.

#### 5.25a.10 Delivery phases (bold, realistic)

Phase 1: Foundation

- AI menu Speech submenu
- Speech Center shell
- installed-voice management for existing Windows native voices

Phase 2: Downloadable voices

- Kokoro and Piper catalog
- download, verify, install, remove
- preferred voice and per-engine defaults

Phase 3: Advanced polish

- A/B preview panel
- storage budget manager and cleanup recommendations
- per-language preferred voice routing
- richer voice profile presets (Narration, Proofread, Fast skim)

#### 5.25a.11 Acceptance criteria

- A new user can install at least one Kokoro or Piper voice in under 3 minutes from Speech Center.
- A user can preview at least two voices and set one preferred without opening Settings.
- A user can remove a voice and recover disk space with clear confirmation and fallback behavior.
- All commands are available through menu, command palette, and keybindings.
- Installer size does not increase due to bundled voice payloads.

#### 5.25a.12 DECtalk compatibility evaluation track

Quill should explicitly evaluate adding DECtalk as an optional speech engine path.

Why consider it:

- DECtalk remains important to many long-time screen-reader and speech users.
- It offers a distinctive speech character some users actively prefer for proofreading and navigation tasks.
- Community-maintained projects (including modern build efforts) suggest practical integration paths worth exploration.

Plan scope (evaluation first, not automatic ship):

- Add `dectalk-local` as a candidate engine in Speech Center behind an experimental flag.
- Prototype voice discovery, preview, and preferred-voice selection through the same Speech lifecycle model used for Kokoro and Piper.
- Keep no-bundle policy: no DECtalk voice payloads included in installer or portable builds.

Hard gates before general availability:

- **Licensing and redistribution clarity**: legal review confirms what can be downloaded, redistributed, or user-supplied.
- **Accessibility parity**: DECtalk path must pass the same screen-reader announcement, keyboard-only, and status reporting requirements as other engines.
- **Stability and performance**: startup, preview, and long-form read-aloud must meet baseline responsiveness and failure-recovery standards.
- **Configuration parity**: preferred voice, per-voice settings, per-engine defaults, and removal behavior must match other engines.

User experience requirements if approved:

- DECtalk appears in `AI -> Speech` as another engine option, not a separate workflow.
- Voice install/onboarding language is plain and explicit about source, size, and any licensing constraints.
- Users can preview and set a DECtalk voice as preferred in one flow.
- Users can remove DECtalk voices and recover storage with deterministic fallback behavior.

Positioning:

- DECtalk is treated as a high-value compatibility and user-preference path.
- It does not replace Windows native, Kokoro, or Piper; it complements them when available and compliant.

### 5.26 Number lines and strip line numbers

A small tool that addresses a real recurring user request.

- `Tools → Number Lines…` opens a dialog with format options: `1.`, `[1]`, `1:`, `1)`, `001`, and a custom Python `str.format` template using `{n}`.
- Start index, increment, zero-padding, and "only number non-blank lines" options.
- Applies to the whole document or selection.
- `Tools → Strip Line Numbers` reverses by regex; the regex used to add numbers is also the regex used to strip them.
- Undo is one step; the tool reports `Numbered 482 lines` or `Stripped numbers from 482 lines`.

### 5.27 Open from URL

- `Ctrl+Alt+O` opens a small dialog with a URL field. Accepts `http://`, `https://`, raw GitHub URLs, gist URLs, and Pastebin URLs.
- Quill downloads the resource to a per-session temp file, detects the format from the response `Content-Type` and the URL extension, and opens it with the appropriate reader.
- Network announcement: the dialog shows the host name and an estimate of bytes (where the server reports `Content-Length`) before download starts; the download is cancellable.
- The opened document has the URL as its display path, no associated file on disk; `Ctrl+S` opens Save As.
- Redirects are followed up to 5 hops; redirects to a different host prompt for confirmation.
- All TLS errors and 4xx/5xx responses are reported with a single readable sentence, no stack traces.

### 5.27a Remote Sites (FTP, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAV, S3)

Remote I/O is the natural extension of "Open from URL": once a user has a saved site, opening and saving is one click, with the same explicit-safety guarantees.

- **File menu → Open from Remote** (default key: QUILL key then `R`) opens a two-pane site list + remote directory browser. Sites are sorted alphabetically; the user can search/filter. The dialog uses native wx controls; the directory pane is a stock `wx.ListCtrl` so screen readers can read filenames in order with no synthesized markup.
- **Save to Remote** (QUILL key then `Shift+R`) and **Save Copy to Remote...** (menu only) use the same dialog in a "Save" mode that includes a target file name field.
- **Manage Remote Sites...** (QUILL key then `Shift+M`) opens the site list editor with **New site...** / **Edit site...** / **Delete site** buttons and a per-protocol sub-dialog (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3) that validates required fields before enabling Save.
- A **site** is `RemoteSite(id, name, protocol, host, port, username, root_dir, trust_first_use, extra)` with protocol-specific fields in `extra` (e.g. `s3_bucket`, `webdav_base`, `s3_endpoint`, `s3_region`, `s3_access_key`, `s3_secret_key`). Sites are persisted to `%APPDATA%\Quill\remote-sites.json` via atomic write; passwords are persisted separately through `quill/core/remote_sites.py` using the Windows Credential Manager → DPAPI file → macOS Keychain ladder.
- **Five transport modules** live in `quill/io/`, all wx-free:
  - `remote_transport.py` — `RemoteTransport` ABC + `RemoteEntry`, `DownloadResult`, `RemoteTransportError`/`RemoteAuthError`/`RemoteNotFoundError`, `chunked_copy`, `merge_headers`.
  - `http_transport.py` — `download_url(url, *, timeout, progress, max_bytes) -> HttpDownload` with verified TLS, default `_MAX_BYTES` cap, visible progress.
  - `ftp_transport.py` — FTP and FTPS open/save, MLSD time parser, listing normalization.
  - `sftp_transport.py` — paramiko SFTP open/save; honours `settings.ssh_trust_first_use` and `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy`.
  - `webdav_transport.py` — depth-1 `PROPFIND` directory listing, basic auth, parsed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring` to refuse DTD/entity expansion.
  - `s3_transport.py` + `s3_sigv4.py` — manual AWS SigV4 signer for Amazon S3 and any S3-compatible endpoint; boto3 path is opportunistic and falls back to the signer when boto3 is missing.
- A document opened from a remote site is **read-only by default**; the title shows `(from site:path)` so the user always knows where it came from. `Save` on a read-only remote document opens **Save Copy to Remote...** instead of overwriting the remote.
- Network egress is gated by `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`; every transport call site has a written rationale. The audit is a CI gate.
- All `Save to Remote` writes use the SSH-style tilde backup: a copy of the previous file lives next to the target as `<name>~`, written in the original newline style.

### 5.28 Format-aware bracket and quote navigation

- `Ctrl+]` and `Ctrl+[` already navigate by block in editor-mode (5.17); when inside a code-aware context (code file, Markdown code fence, HTML tag), they instead jump to the matching bracket, quote, fence, or HTML tag.
- `Ctrl+Shift+\` is the explicit "Match Bracket" command (also reachable from Navigate menu).
- `Ctrl+Shift+]` extends the selection from the cursor to the matching bracket.
- Bracket matching is language-aware: respects strings and comments in supported languages; Markdown respects fence boundaries.
- The match is announced as `Matched bracket on line N, column C` so screen-reader users do not lose context.

### 5.28a Document Language profiles and auto-detection (#181)

Each document has a **language profile** (`quill/core/language_profile.py`) describing one programming/markup language: extensions, indent convention, comment syntax, brackets, keyword set, and a `markup_kind` (`"html"`, `"markdown"`, or `"plain"`). Recognised languages: HTML, Markdown, CSS, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, C#, PHP, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Shell, YAML, JSON, TOML, SQL, plus a plain-text fallback. The profile is wx-free, pure data.

- **Auto-assignment.** On open and on tab creation the profile is set from the file extension (`get_profile_for_path`), unless the user has pinned one.
- **User override.** `set_document_language` pins a profile for the current tab (`_DocumentTab._language_profile` + `_language_profile_pinned`). Reachable via `navigate.set_language` (default **Ctrl+Shift+L**), **Navigate > Set Document Language...**, the **Format > Document Language** radio submenu (Auto-detect + every profile + Plain text, current item checked), and Enter on the status-bar **Language** segment (which appends "(set)" when pinned). "Auto-detect from file" clears the override.
- **The pin drives editing characteristics.** A pinned profile is the source of truth ahead of path/content inference via `_pinned_markup_kind()`, `_current_markup_context()`, and `_effective_markup_kind()`: bold/italic surface, the heading/table/list/tag menu enablement, comment toggling (`format_ops.toggle_line/block_comment` accept the profile), heading and structure navigation, the outline, link insertion, and live preview all follow it.
- **Editing aid, not a rename.** Pinning never changes the file format; when the profile's extension doesn't match the file, a Save As hint is announced. The override is tab-only (not persisted across reopen).

**Automatic detection** (`quill/core/language_detect.py`, wx-free, deterministic, no ML) scores the buffer over the languages above using weighted structural signals, then applies confidence discipline modelled on VS Code's detector: an absolute floor, a relative margin over the runner-up, ambiguity penalties (YAML/TOML/SQL), optional session-history bias, and a `should_switch()` hysteresis gate. It returns `language=None` (plain) when unsure and does not misfire on prose or ASCII-braille.

- **Setting:** `language_detection_mode` ∈ {`off` (default), `hint`, `prompt`, `auto`}, exposed in **Settings > Editing**.
- **Trigger:** `LanguageDetectMixin` debounces content changes (~800 ms) and runs **only** on unpinned untitled/`.txt`-like documents; it never overrides a real extension or a user pin.
- **Behaviour by mode:** `hint` updates the status bar silently; `prompt` announces a dismissible suggestion; `auto` calls `set_document_language` and announces the change. A screen-reader user is informed in every mode (no silent or visual-only switch). Braille content is out of scope — Braille Mode owns it.

### 5.29 Format menu (text transforms, no styling)

A dedicated menu surfacing transforms that are otherwise reachable via Tools or shortcuts. The menu exists because discoverability matters more than purity.

- Capitalisation: Upper Case, Lower Case, Title Case, Sentence Case, Toggle Case.
- Lines: Move Line Up/Down, Duplicate Line, Delete Line, Join Lines, Toggle Line Comment, Toggle Block Comment.
- Indent: Indent, Outdent, Convert to Tabs, Convert to Spaces, Set Indent Width….
- Markdown helpers: Insert Heading (levels 1–6), Insert Bullet List, Insert Numbered List, Insert Task List, Insert Table…, Insert Link…, Insert Code Block, Insert Footnote.
- Markdown list editing behavior: `Enter` continues bullet/numbered/task items, `Enter` on an empty marker exits the list, and `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` nest or promote list items when the caret is on a list line.
- List Manager: `Format -> List -> List Manager...` (`Ctrl+Alt+L`) opens a keyboard-first tree editor for moving, promoting/demoting, adding, editing, and deleting list items.
- Magical tag helpers: Insert HTML Tag… (with attribute picker) and Insert Markdown Tag… (semantic snippet picker).
- Snippet helpers: Insert Snippet… (`Ctrl+Alt+Space`) and Manage Snippets… (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Space`) with searchable filtering, placeholder prompts, and starter-pack onboarding.
- Prediction helpers: Word Prediction… (`Ctrl+.`) with words, HTML tags, and Markdown tag completions.
- Surface-aware formatting shortcuts (Markdown/HTML only): `Ctrl+B` bold, `Ctrl+I` italic, and heading levels `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+6`.
- Re-flow: Wrap to Column…, Re-flow Paragraph.

### 5.29a Magical HTML and Markdown tag picker

- `Format → Insert HTML Tag…` opens a keyboard-first picker of common tags (`section`, `article`, headings, list/table tags, inline emphasis, links, images, code).
- After selecting a tag, Quill prompts for optional attributes in a compact `key=value; key2=value2` format and inserts valid tag text into the editor.
- If text is selected, Quill wraps the selection in the chosen non-void tag. If not selected, Quill inserts an opening/closing pair and places the cursor between them. Void tags (`img`, `br`, `hr`, `input`) are inserted self-closing.
- `Format → Insert Markdown Tag…` opens a semantic picker (`Bold`, `Italic`, `Inline Code`, `Code Block`, `Heading`, `List`, `Task List`, `Blockquote`, `Link`, `Image`, `Table`, `Footnote`) and inserts the matching markdown snippet.
- For Link and Image, Quill asks for the target URL and composes the final markdown in one action.
- All picker actions are mirrored in the command palette and are keybindable through the keymap system.
- `Edit → Insert Link…` (`Ctrl+K`) uses a format-aware inserter: markdown links in Markdown docs, `<a href>` in HTML docs, and `text (url)` form in plain text.

### 5.29b Snippet insertion and trigger expansion

- Snippets are stored locally under `%APPDATA%\Quill\snippets\snippets.json` with atomic writes.
- `Format → Insert Snippet…` opens the same keyboard-first searchable picker pattern used across Quill insertion flows.
- Supported placeholders in snippet bodies: `${input:name}`, `${choice:a|b}`, `${date}`, `${time}`, `${cursor}`.
- Trigger expansion can run while typing (for example `;meeting` plus a delimiter), and remains user-controllable via General Preferences.
- Starter packs are installable from Preferences and snippet management so onboarding can begin with practical templates.

### 5.29c Word prediction and tag IntelliSense

- `Ctrl+.` opens a prediction picker that reuses the same accessible searchable-pattern UX as other insertion dialogs.
- Predictions draw from the current document words, the merged spell dictionaries, and the HTML/Markdown tag vocabularies Quill already ships.
- When enabled in General Preferences, the same helper can auto-refresh while typing so the prediction list follows the current fragment.
- Accepting a prediction inserts the chosen word or tag completion at the caret; Escape dismisses the popup without changing text.

### 5.30 Bookmark export and import

- `Tools → Bookmarks → Export…` writes the bookmark set for the current document to a single JSON file alongside its hash so it round-trips cleanly.
- `Tools → Bookmarks → Import…` adds bookmarks from a file, with a preview dialog showing each bookmark and a per-row checkbox.
- Conflict resolution: on import, identical names produce a numbered suffix; identical positions are merged.
- A second action, `Tools → Bookmarks → Export All…`, writes every bookmark across every document the user has ever opened, useful for moving machines.

### 5.31 Trusted locations (Office-style)

- `Settings → Privacy → Trusted Locations` is a list of folders Quill opens without extra prompts.
- Files opened from outside trusted locations that are unusually large (default >25 MB), password-protected, or in a Grade B/C format show a one-time prompt: `Open <path>?` with Open, Open and Trust this folder, Cancel.
- Network-mounted folders are never auto-trusted; a setting must enable them explicitly.
- The trusted locations list is editable, exportable, and importable.

### 5.32 Jump List and shell integration

- Windows Taskbar Jump List shows Recent Files (last 10) and Pinned Files; Tasks include `New Document`, `Open File…`, and `Open from URL…`.
- Implementation via `pywin32`'s `ICustomDestinationList`.
- Shell context menu entries (registered from `Settings → Files`):
  - `Open with Quill` for every registered extension.
  - `Open with Quill (As Plain Text)` for every text-like extension, forcing the plain-text reader regardless of detected format.
  - **Open Folder With Quill** is deferred to v1.1 (it implies a folder-tree panel).
- All shell verbs install per-user (no admin elevation required) and uninstall cleanly.

### 5.33 Diagnostics and bug reporting

- `Help → Report a Bug…` is the unified support flow. It opens an in-app review screen with the report summary and destination URL, supports optional diagnostics zip generation, copies the environment summary to the clipboard, and then opens a pre-filled Community Access support-hub issue form in the default browser with no logs; the user reviews and submits manually.
- `Help → Save Diagnostics…` remains available for standalone diagnostics export and writes a zip with:
  - the last 7 days of logs (action names and outcomes only; no document content),
  - settings (with API keys redacted),
  - the active keymap,
  - the last 50 commands executed,
  - the screen-reader detection result and version (if available),
  - basic environment info (Windows build, Python build, wxPython build, locale).
- Nothing leaves the machine. The user chooses where to save the zip and what to do with it.

#### 5.33a Crash reports offer to submit (#622)

- When an unhandled exception closes QUILL, the excepthook writes the traceback to a timestamped file under `app_data_dir()/crash-reports/`, then schedules a crash-submit dialog on the UI thread via `wx.CallAfter`. The dialog shows a redacted preview (the last 10 commands, the active document's name and encoding, the platform and screen-reader information, the last 12 traceback frames), three free-text fields ("What were you doing?", "What command triggered it?", "Expected behaviour"), and three buttons: **Send report**, **Copy to clipboard**, **Don't send**.
- The default button is **Don't send** so a user who opens the dialog by accident does not accidentally send anything. Escape is bound to **Don't send**. Initial focus lands on the **What were you doing** field so the screen reader announces the first input first, not the buttons.
- `Send report` calls `quill.core.issue_submit.submit_crash_issue` with the redacted body and metadata. A configured GitHub token is required; if the token is absent the report is copied to the clipboard instead, and nothing is submitted silently.
- Every step is wrapped in `try/except` so a misbehaving dialog path can never prevent the local crash file from being saved or the standard interpreter traceback from firing. The native `ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW` from finding #51 remains the always-on fallback when wx is unavailable, no `wx.App` is running yet, the user turned the setting off, or the dialog path raised.
- `Settings > General > Offer to send crash reports automatically` (`auto_ask_crash_submit`) controls whether the dialog appears; the default is `True` during the beta phase so the team can hear about crashes without forcing the user to opt in every time. The local crash file is always written regardless of the setting.
- The dialog is added to the dialog inventory and follows the same `apply_modal_ids` + `_show_modal_dialog` contract as every other modal in QUILL. The dialog's parent is the real `wx.Frame` (`MainFrame.frame`), not the `MainFrame` mixin, per the #624 fix in `quill/ui/main_frame_hygiene.py`.

### 5.34 Welcome and Keyboard Reference

- **Welcome** opens a tutorial document in a new tab that walks new users through the editor, command palette, outline navigator, find/F3, spell check, and accessibility audit. The document is editable; users can save their own annotated copy.
- **Keyboard Reference** is auto-generated from the active command registry and the current feature profile. It is available in two formats:
  1. **Markdown Document**: Grouped by menu, opens in the editor for easy searching and navigation.
  2 la **Dynamic HTML Export**: A self-contained, accessible HTML page that reflects all active bindings, including custom re-assignments.
  
  The reference explicitly documents the **QUILL Key layered system**, including the one-shot **Prefix Layer** and the locked **Browse Layer (Quick Nav)**. This ensures the reference is a precise mirror of the current editor state.
- **Tip of the Day** is off by default; when on, it appears once per launch as a small dismissible dialog with a single tip drawn from real palette actions, each tip a one-liner with a `Try it` button that runs the action.

### 5.35 Notifications centre

- The status bar's **Notifications** cell holds Quill's announcements: available updates, recovered autosave snapshots offered on launch, finished AI tasks, finished long-running OCR or extraction jobs, and any plugin messages.
- `Enter` on the cell opens a small Notifications dialog (stock `wx.ListBox` with timestamps); Delete dismisses individual entries; `Shift+Delete` dismisses all.
- Quill never raises toast or balloon notifications. All asynchronous events surface here and on the status bar's Background Tasks cell.

### 5.36 "What changed on save" (opt-in)

- Off by default. When on (`Settings → Reading → Announce save summary`), every successful save announces a one-liner: `Saved chapter-7.md, 4 lines changed, 38 words added`.
- Computed by diffing the previous saved bytes against the new bytes; cheap on documents up to 5 MB.
- Useful for ambient awareness during long editing sessions; trivially ignorable for users who prefer silence.

### 5.37 Link tools

A small family of related commands that make working with links comfortable for screen-reader users.

- **Insert link** (`Ctrl+K`): opens a small dialog with URL and display text fields. If a URL is on the clipboard, the URL field is pre-filled. If a selection exists, it becomes the display text. Enter inserts `[text](url)` in Markdown, `<a href="url">text</a>` in HTML, a plain URL in plain text, and a properly escaped link in reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, Org, and Textile. Cancel restores the cursor.
- **Insert quoted text** (`Ctrl+Shift+>`): indents the selection by one level of `>` for Markdown and email-style replies. `Ctrl+Shift+<` dedents one level. `Tools → Strip Quote Markers` removes them entirely. Idempotent: re-indenting a block already at level N goes to N+1, not back to 1.
- **Follow link** (`Ctrl+Enter`): when the cursor is on a Markdown link, HTML `href`, or a plain URL, opens it in the default browser. The status bar announces the destination host first (`Opening github.com…`) so the user always knows what they are about to open. Anchor links inside the current document jump in-editor instead.
- **Reveal link target** (`Ctrl+Shift+Enter`): announces the target without opening it (`Link target: https://example.com/path`).
- **Copy link target** (`Ctrl+Alt+K`): copies the URL of the link under the cursor.

### 5.38 Document properties and front-matter

- **Document properties dialog** (`File → Document Properties…`): edit document language (BCP-47 tag), title, author, description, keywords. For DOCX, EPUB, HTML, ODT these write into the document's metadata in place; for plain text, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, Org, and Typst they write into a sidecar `<filename>.quill.yml`. The document language drives the spell-check dictionary stack automatically.
- **Front-matter editor** (`Ctrl+Alt+F`): when the cursor is in or above YAML or TOML front-matter (Jekyll, Hugo, Zola, Quarto, Pandoc styles), opens a structured editor. Each key becomes a labelled `wx.StaticText` plus `wx.TextCtrl` pair. Save writes back as valid YAML or TOML, preserving comments and ordering wherever possible. New keys can be added; required keys (configurable per project) are highlighted.
- The front-matter editor recognises common keys (`title`, `date`, `author`, `tags`, `categories`, `draft`, `slug`, `description`, `lang`, `permalink`) and gives them sensible widgets (date picker for dates, multi-line for description, etc.). Unknown keys get a plain text field.

### 5.39 Autosave control and persistent undo

- **Autosave** is on by default at 30-second intervals. The status bar gains an **Autosave** cell showing `Autosave: 30 s` or `Autosave: off`. Enter cycles 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 5 min, off. Settings dialog exposes the same plus a custom interval.
- **Persistent undo** keeps each document's undo stack alongside its autosave snapshots. Reopening a recently closed document restores up to 100 undo steps. Off by default for plain-text files larger than 5 MB. Stored in `%APPDATA%\Quill\undo\<hash>.undo`, atomically written, auto-pruned at 30 days.
- **Crash-safe autosave**: snapshots write to `…snap.tmp` and rename to `…snap` on flush so a power loss mid-write cannot corrupt the recovery store.

### 5.39a Restore points — per-save document history (shipped 0.9.0 Beta 1)

The first shipped slice of the QUILL Sync plan (`docs/planning/quill-sync-plan.md`, section 7): document versioning, entirely offline, with no sync engine involved.

**Model.** Every successful save snapshots the document's canonical text into a content-addressed store (`restore_points/<doc-key>/blobs/<sha256>.txt` + an atomically-written `index.json`, under the QUILL data dir). Content addressing makes unchanged saves free and gives dedup without reference counting. The store is wx-free, strict-typed `quill/core/restore_points.py`.

**Invariants.**

- Recording is best-effort by contract: the save-path hook (`_record_save_restore_point`, called from the `_write_document_to_disk` chokepoint so every save path is covered) is fully guarded — a snapshot failure can never be the reason a save fails.
- Restoring is itself reversible: the current text is recorded as a restore point (source `restore`) before it is replaced, and the restore lands in the editor as a modified buffer — nothing touches disk until the user saves.
- Retention thins by age (keep 7 days fully, then daily to 30 days, then weekly) under a per-document size cap (`restore_points_max_mb`, default 200, clamped 10-5000); the newest five versions are never pruned regardless of the cap.
- Documents over 20 MB of text are not snapshotted (the cap would be consumed by a handful of saves).

**UI.** `File > Restore Previous Version...` (command `file.restore_previous_version`, assignable, no default key) lists versions with speakable labels ("Today at 4:12 PM - 2,341 words", "(before a restore)" marking pre-restore snapshots), skips the version identical to the current editor text, and offers **Restore** (confirmed, announced, one editor-level undo of a restore via the pre-restore snapshot) and **Open as Copy** (a new untitled tab). Settings: **Keep restore points when saving** (default on) and the disk limit, both with speakable specs.

**Relationship to the other safety nets.** Persistent undo is in-session; `core.backups` keeps the single pre-save `.bak`; restore points are the cross-session, long-horizon history above both. The Sync plan's later phases reuse this exact store as the sync engine's version layer.

### 5.40 Paragraph, line, and footnote refinements

- **Join paragraph** (`Ctrl+Shift+J`): collapses a wrapped paragraph (the kind produced by plain-text email or older PDF extracts) into a single line, preserving sentence-internal spacing. Works on the current paragraph or selection. Idempotent.
- **Move line preserves selection**: `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` (line move, 5.18) keep the same logical selection range so the user does not lose context after moving.
- **Markdown heading auto-numbering** (`Tools → Toggle Heading Numbers`): adds `1.`, `1.1`, `1.1.1` prefixes across all headings, re-numbering in document order. Re-running removes them. Idempotent. Works in HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, Org, Typst as well.
- **Footnote helper**:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+.` (period) inserts a Markdown footnote pair at the cursor and jumps the cursor into the definition block; pressing `Ctrl+Alt+.` again returns to the reference site.
  - `Tools → Renumber Footnotes` reorders footnote labels into document order (1, 2, 3…), updating both references and definitions.
  - The same command works for reStructuredText auto-numbered footnotes (`[#]_`) and Pandoc-style inline notes.

### 5.41 Search-and-replace preview and saved searches

- **Replace preview**: when a Replace All would change more than 25 occurrences (threshold configurable), Quill shows a preview dialog listing up to the first 50 changes with line numbers and before/after text. Buttons: Replace All, Cancel, Replace Selected (in case the user unticks rows). Always shows the total count.
- **Saved searches**: a search term plus its options (case, whole word, regex, in-selection) can be saved under a name via `Find → Save This Search…`. `Ctrl+Shift+F3` opens the saved-search picker (stock `wx.ListBox`); Enter runs it as if F3 had been pressed. Stored in `%APPDATA%\Quill\saved-searches.json`, exportable/importable.

### 5.42 Sort and transform details

`Tools → Sort Selected Lines…` and the related transforms (5.18) are spec'd here in full:

- Direction: ascending or descending.
- Case sensitivity: on or off.
- Numeric mode: lexicographic (`item10` before `item2`) or natural-numeric (`item2` before `item10`).
- Date-aware mode: parse leading ISO-8601 or `dd/mm/yyyy` dates; sort chronologically.
- Header row: preserved as the first line if checked.
- Stable sort always; equal lines preserve their relative order.
- Remove Duplicate Lines: optional "keep first" vs. "keep last"; reports `Removed 13 duplicate lines, 287 remain`.
- Reverse Lines: simple reverse, preserves blank lines.

### 5.43 Save All with conflict detection and per-file format memory

- **Save All** (`Ctrl+Alt+S` reserved; default is `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S` so it doesn't clash with Document Statistics) saves every modified document. If the external watcher detects that one or more files changed on disk since they were opened, Save All opens a per-file resolution dialog: Keep Mine, Take Theirs, Open Diff. Defaults to Keep Mine with no destructive action until the user confirms.
- **Per-file format memory**: Quill remembers per-path the user's last choices for encoding, line endings, wrap, indent width, tabs-vs-spaces, and spell-check language. On reopening the file those settings are restored. Setting toggle: `Settings → Files → Remember per-file format choices` (on by default). Storage in `%APPDATA%\Quill\file-prefs.json`, keyed by SHA-1 of the path.

### 5.44 Per-document scratchpad

- `Ctrl+Alt+N` opens a small non-modal Scratchpad window tied to the current document. The Scratchpad is a second `wx.TextCtrl` with its own save and word count.
- Each scratchpad is persisted at `%APPDATA%\Quill\notes\<hash>.md` keyed by document path.
- When the underlying document is moved or renamed, Quill detects the orphan note next time the document is opened and offers `Re-attach note to current document?` (Yes / No / Show note).
- Scratchpads use the same spell-check stack as their parent document but are excluded from accessibility audits.

### 5.45 Section folding (announce-only) — shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3

A folding model designed for screen-reader users: fold state is spoken metadata, never visual line-hiding, and the document text is never mutated. Implemented in `quill/core/code_folding.py` (pure region detection, wx-free) plus `MainFrame` command wiring; see `x.md`'s original "PRD: Code Folding" for the accessibility rationale behind the design decisions below.

Two kinds of foldable region are detected, both reusing existing infrastructure rather than adding a new parser: **heading sections** (via the existing `extract_outline_entries`, so a heading's region runs to the next heading at the same-or-higher level) and **fenced code blocks** (` ``` `...` ``` `, each complete fence is one atomic region). The original spec above called for heading-only folding with a fold-to-level chord sequence; the shipped version covers headings and code fences with a simpler single-toggle model, and does not yet implement fold-to-level or Find auto-unfold — both remain open follow-ups (see below).

- **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F** (`edit.toggle_fold`) — folds or unfolds the smallest foldable region containing the cursor, announcing `"Folded: 14 lines under 'Background'"` / `"Unfolded: 'Background'"`. (The original spec's `Ctrl+Shift+[`/`Ctrl+Shift+]` were reused for other bindings by the time this shipped; a single toggle command was chosen over a separate fold/unfold pair for a smaller keymap footprint.)
- **Alt+Shift+]** / **Alt+Shift+[** (`navigate.next_fold` / `navigate.previous_fold`) — jump between foldable region *boundaries*, folded or not, announcing the region's label, fold state, and line count on arrival. This is the safe, honest version of "skip folded content": it only fires on a command that already jumps by structural unit, never on literal arrow-key movement, which is never intercepted.
- **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L** (`tools.list_folds`) — the accessible equivalent of scanning gutter fold triangles: a dialog (reusing the same tree-navigator pattern as `list_bookmarks`/Outline Navigator) listing every foldable region with its fold state and line count, letting a user jump or toggle without ever needing to encounter a region by scrolling past it.
- Folding state is per-tab and session-only, never written to file or `DocumentMemory` — deliberately, since persisting it would need edit-resilient position tracking (like `InlineNote`'s quote-anchoring) for a feature whose entire value is "reduce clutter right now."
- Outline Navigator (5.16) remains the primary navigation tool; folding is the in-editor companion, and `List Folds` is folding's own navigator-style surface.

**Not yet implemented** (open follow-ups from the original spec): fold-to-level chord sequences (`Ctrl+Shift+K Ctrl+Shift+0`/`J`); Find auto-unfolding a region it matches inside (moot today since folding never hides text from Find or any other text-reading operation — only the four commands above are fold-aware); per-function/indentation-based folding for real source files edited via a Quillin (fenced-block granularity is the right scope for a writing app with embedded code, not an IDE, and was an explicit scope decision, not an oversight).

### 5.46 Spell-check ignore directives and manual bilingual flag

- **Per-document ignore directives**. Quill honours a magic comment that lists words to ignore in this document only:
  - HTML / Markdown: `<!-- quill: ignore-spell "frobnicate", "wibble" -->`
  - Plain text and code (using the file's comment marker): `# quill: ignore-spell frobnicate, wibble`
  - YAML / TOML front-matter: `quill_ignore_spell: [frobnicate, wibble]`
- The ignore set is merged into the active dictionary stack as a transient per-document layer.
- **Manual bilingual paragraph flag** (`Ctrl+Alt+B`): toggles a per-paragraph language override. The user types or picks a BCP-47 tag; the paragraph is marked in the sidecar `.quill.yml`; the spell-check stack swaps for that paragraph. Per-paragraph auto-detection remains in the backlog; this manual flow is reliable today.

### 5.47 Word boundary mode, trailing whitespace, case-change announcement

- **Word boundary mode** (`Settings → Editing → Word Boundary Mode`):
  - **Default**: Unicode word breaks (UAX #29). Best for prose.
  - **Whitespace**: only whitespace separates words. Best for log files.
  - **Programmer**: also breaks on `_`, `-`, `.`, and case transitions (`getFoo` is three "words": `get`, `Foo`, plus the case boundary). Best for code.
- The mode affects `Ctrl+Left`/`Right`, `Ctrl+Delete`/`Backspace`, double-click selection, word count, and the spell-check tokeniser.
- **Trailing whitespace announcement**: when the cursor lands on a line that ends with trailing whitespace, the status bar's Line/Column cell appends `(trailing whitespace)` and a screen-reader-friendly hint is available via Where Am I. No visual highlight; no extra speech while typing.
- **Case-change announcement guard**: when `Ctrl+Shift+U`, `Ctrl+L`, or `Ctrl+Shift+T` apply to the whole document because nothing was selected, the announcement explicitly says so and reminds the user `Press Ctrl+Z to undo full-document case change`.

### 5.48 Multi-format export and reading view

- **Export panel** (`File → Export…`): one dialog with target format choices: HTML, DOCX, plain text, Markdown, reStructuredText, and PDF (via Markdown → HTML → system print-to-PDF). Per-format options inline (heading numbering, table-of-contents inclusion, embedded CSS yes/no, page size for PDF).
- **Reading view** (`View → Toggle Reading View`): toggles the editor between source view and a clean reading representation for HTML and Markdown. Still a `wx.TextCtrl` — same accessibility, just a different render: links unwrapped to `text (url)`, headings prefixed by their level, lists rendered with consistent markers, code blocks framed by a horizontal rule. Editing is disabled in reading view (the cell announces this); toggle off to edit.

### 5.49 Welcome-back snapshot

- On launch, if the user closed Quill cleanly with N documents open last time, a single prompt offers `Reopen the 3 documents from your last session?` with Yes / No / Show me.
- "Show me" opens a small list of the documents (paths, last cursor positions) and lets the user pick a subset.
- Always opt-in per launch; the global "restore session" setting is separate and stays off by default.

### 5.50 Per-document keymap override (with explicit consent)

- A document's sidecar `.quill.yml` may declare a `keymap_override` block.
- Quill never applies it silently. On opening such a document, the user sees a one-time confirmation: `This document requests a different keymap. Apply for this document only?` with Yes / No / Always for this document. The decision is remembered per-document path.
- Overrides are scoped: they only apply while the document has focus, never global.
- A small lock icon appears in the document name status-bar cell (announced as `keymap override active`) whenever an override is in effect.

### 5.51 Settings export, import, and partitioned reset

- `Settings → Export…` writes a single zip containing settings, keymap, templates, snippets, personal dictionary, saved searches, and bookmarks. API keys are excluded; the user is told so explicitly in the dialog.
- `Settings → Import…` previews every change in a stock `wx.ListBox` and requires Enter to commit. Conflicts (e.g. a keymap rebind that contradicts the current keymap) are flagged inline.
- `Settings → Reset to Defaults…` opens a partitioned reset dialog with checkboxes for: Keymap, Appearance, Spell-check learning, Templates and snippets, Recent files, Bookmarks, Everything. Never silent; every reset shows a confirmation listing what will be lost.

### 5.52 Document fingerprint

- Every saved document has a SHA-256 fingerprint of its bytes shown in `File → Document Properties…` and copyable from a button.
- Useful for accessibility certification workflows where the user must prove they reviewed a specific version, and for forensic comparison.
- The fingerprint also surfaces in the diagnostics bundle (5.33) for any open document, scrubbed of path.

### 5.53 Unicode insert

- `Ctrl+Alt+U` opens a search dialog over the Unicode name database (`unicodedata` from the standard library). Type any part of a character name; matching characters appear in a stock `wx.ListBox` with code point, name, and the literal character.
- Categories shown as one-line filters: Letters, Marks, Numbers, Punctuation, Symbols, Separators, Other. Click or type the category prefix to scope.
- Pinned favourites for common needs: em-dash, en-dash, ellipsis, smart quotes, currency symbols, mathematical operators.
- Recent characters list keeps the last 20.

### 5.54 Idle-time prefetch

- When the user opens a file from a folder, Quill background-extracts the next and previous files alphabetically into the in-memory document cache so opening them feels instant.
- Bounded by available memory and by a hard cap of 50 MB total prefetch.
- Cancelled immediately on any other extraction or AI task.
- Opt-out switch in `Settings → General → Prefetch neighbouring files`.

### 5.55 Atomic on-disk stores

- All Quill-managed JSON stores (bookmarks, settings, keymap, recent, saved searches, file prefs, notes index) write to `<store>.tmp` and rename atomically.
- A `<store>.bak` is kept of the last good version. On startup, if the primary store fails to parse, Quill renames it to `<store>.broken-<timestamp>.json`, falls back to the `.bak`, and announces `Recovered <store> from backup`.
- This eliminates the worst class of "my bookmarks vanished after a crash" bugs.

### 5.56 First-run onboarding

A five-step welcome flow the first time Quill launches. Each step is a normal modal page (no carousel, no animation). Skip is always available; the chosen values are written through the same Settings code path as any later change.

1. **Profile**: System, Word-like, Vim, Emacs.
2. **Theme**: System, Light, Dark, High Contrast.
3. **Spell-check languages**: multi-select from the bundled launch set; the active document language is added automatically when later opened.
4. **AI provider**: Off (default), Ollama local, Ollama Cloud, OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, OpenRouter, Gemini, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. (Azure OpenAI is not currently supported; it is a possible future addition — see AI-15.) Providers include sensible default hosts where possible; advanced custom mode allows manual endpoint override. If a provider is picked, the API-key dialog opens when required; the key is stored via Windows Credential Manager with a DPAPI-encrypted fallback (10.11). Network is never used without explicit per-action consent.
5. **Telemetry**: confirms it stays off (default). A short plain-language sentence explains what telemetry would collect if turned on later.

The onboarding completion writes `%APPDATA%\Quill\onboarding-complete.json`. Trust and privacy consent acknowledgement is stored separately in `%APPDATA%\Quill\trust-consent.json` and is versioned so policy text updates can require re-acknowledgement. Re-running `Help → Run Onboarding Again` reopens the flow without resetting anything else.

### 5.57 Privacy summary

- A single-screen plain-language statement of what Quill does and does not send over the network. Linked from `Help → Privacy Summary` and shown once during onboarding.
- Content is audited by the cognitive-accessibility plain-language linter (9.8): Flesch ≥ 60, controlled vocabulary, one idea per sentence.
- Says explicitly: documents never leave the machine without an explicit per-action confirmation; the only outbound calls v1.0 makes without confirmation are the manual update check and the optional crash-report upload (5.71), both opt-in.

### 5.58 Licenses screen

- `Help → Licenses` opens `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (auto-generated at build time, 10.2.4) in the editor.
- The file lists every bundled component, its version, its license text, and a one-line use justification.
- Required for procurement; required by some bundled licenses.

### 5.59 Crash recovery transparency

When Quill detects an autosave snapshot newer than the on-disk file on launch:

- The recovery dialog names the file, the snapshot timestamp, the byte count, and offers four actions: **Recover**, **Compare with on-disk**, **Discard snapshot**, **Cancel** (decide later).
- **Compare with on-disk** opens the diff view (5.22) immediately.
- The dialog is screen-reader-friendly first: every value is a separate labelled `wx.StaticText` so it reads cleanly.
- Choosing Recover writes the snapshot as a new unsaved document; the on-disk file is **never** overwritten without an explicit Save.

**Offer suppression on inconclusive exits — shipped 0.9.0 Beta 3 (#940/#948).** `begin_session()` in `core/recovery.py` now calls `_log_shows_actionable_error(logs_dir)` before appending a `RecoveryOffer`: it scans the tail (last 256 KB) of `quill.log` for `ERROR`/`CRITICAL`/`Traceback` markers, and suppresses the offer entirely when none are found -- an exit with no error evidence in the log is indistinguishable from an external termination (OS shutdown, forced close) and gets no "Quill detected an unclean exit" prompt. A missing log file fails open (still offers recovery) since an absent log is inconclusive, not evidence of nothing having happened. The autosave snapshot itself is untouched either way; only the *offer* is gated.

### 5.60 Read-only document mode

- `View → Read-Only Mode` (`Ctrl+Shift+L` by default) toggles the editor's editability without touching file permissions.
- Toggle state is per-document; announced when toggled (`Read-only mode on` / `off`).
- Status bar's **Modified state** cell shows `Read-only` while on; attempts to type are silently ignored and a single discreet announcement (`Editor is read-only; press Ctrl+Shift+L to allow editing`) fires the first time per session.
- All navigation, Find, Outline, Read Aloud, Statistics, and Accessibility Audit continue to work.

### 5.61 File-related menu helpers

- `File → Reveal in File Explorer` opens Explorer with the current file selected.
- `File → Copy Full Path`, `File → Copy File Name` copy the corresponding string to the clipboard with a confirmation announcement.
- `File → Show Containing Folder in Quill` is deferred to v1.1 (depends on the folder panel).

### 5.62 Open Recent enhancements

- `File → Open Recent` includes per-entry **Pin / Unpin** and a top-level **Open All Pinned** action.
- Pinned items are not subject to the recent-list cap (default 10) and appear at the top of the submenu.
- Pinned entries are persisted in `recent.json` and survive Clear Recent (which only clears unpinned entries).

### 5.63 Document timeline

- `Tools → Document Timeline…` opens a chronological list (stock `wx.ListBox`) of every backup and autosave snapshot for the current document, with timestamp, size, and source (save backup vs. autosave snapshot).
- Each row has **Open in new tab**, **Compare with current**, and **Restore** (with confirmation) actions.
- The backing store already exists (5.13 + 5.39); this is the unified UI on top.
- Per-document, never global.

### 5.64 Sentence and paragraph navigation

- `Ctrl+Up` / `Ctrl+Down` already navigate by paragraph (standard wx behaviour).
- `Alt+Right` / `Alt+Left` move to the next / previous **sentence** and announce the sentence text (truncated to 200 characters around the cursor for braille and speech).
- Sentence detection uses the `regex` Unicode word-boundary tables plus a per-language abbreviation list (`Mr.`, `Dr.`, `e.g.`, etc.) that ships with each Hunspell language pack and is user-extendable in Settings.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right` / `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left` extend the selection by sentence.

### 5.65 Word-count goal per document

- `File → Document Properties…` gains a **Word goal** integer field (0 disables).
- The status bar's **Word count** cell appends `(243 of 1500)` when a goal is set; on crossing the threshold Quill announces `Word goal reached: 1500 words`.
- The goal is stored alongside other metadata in the document container or in the `.quill.yml` sidecar.

### 5.66 Reading position memory per document

- On close, Quill records cursor line/column and scroll offset for the current document.
- On reopen, the cursor is restored; the status bar announces `Restored to line N` on first focus into the editor.
- Storage keyed by the document's path SHA-1 in `file-prefs.json` (10.5).
- Setting toggle `Settings → Editing → Restore reading position` (on by default).
- Independent of Welcome-Back snapshot (5.49); works even when only a single document is opened directly from Explorer.

### 5.67 Compare with clipboard

- `Tools → Compare With Clipboard` runs the unified-diff machinery (5.22) with the current document as `before` and the clipboard contents as `after`.
- Useful when reviewing a single suggestion pasted from chat or email.
- Refuses if the clipboard is empty or larger than 5 MB; explains why.

### 5.68 Insert from file

- `File → Insert From File…` inserts another file's text at the current cursor without opening it as a separate document.
- Uses the same format detection as Open; for non-text formats Quill extracts plain text and confirms before inserting.
- Files over 1 MB show a confirmation dialog with the byte count and the first line of content.

### 5.69 Selection-statistics direct shortcut

- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` runs Document Statistics scoped to the current selection without first opening the full-document dialog.
- Same dialog as 5.19 but with the title prefixed `Statistics — Selection`.
- Reassignable like any other binding.

### 5.70 Sound notifications and QSP sound packs (opt-in)

QUILL plays short, screen-reader-respectful audio cues (earcons) at meaningful editing moments. The system is built around **QSP (QUILL Sound Packs)**: swappable bundles that map event IDs to audio files. Playback is non-blocking, fire-and-forget, and pre-buffered so there is no perceptible lag between event and sound. Earcons supplement speech; they never replace it. (This section absorbs the former `docs/wsp.md` sound-design notes and `docs/sound-packs.md` pack guide.)

**Pack selection and resolution.** Bundled packs live as directories under `quill/assets/sound_packs/` (the default earcon pack is `ink`, "QUILL's pack"; `indent_*` are the separate indentation-tone overlays). `sound_pack.available_sound_packs()` discovers the bundled earcon packs (default first, `indent_*` excluded) for the **first-run wizard's Sound-pack dropdown** — which replaced a `*.qsp` file picker that could not select the shipped packs at all, since they are folders, not files. The chosen pack is stored in `settings.sound_pack_path` as one of: `""` (the default pack, for back-compat), `bundled:<id>` (another bundled pack, resolved against the install so it survives a move/reinstall), or a direct path (a user's own pack). `sound_pack.resolve_sound_pack_path()` maps any of those to a pack path, and `SoundManager._load_pack` uses it, so enabling sound always falls back to QUILL's pack rather than going silent.

#### 5.70.1 QSP format

A `.qsp` file is a ZIP archive whose root holds `manifest.json` and the referenced WAV files. During development a directory with the same layout is accepted; the loader treats a directory and a ZIP identically. The manifest is validated at load time against `quill/core/schemas/sound_pack.json`:

```json
{
  "format": "qsp",
  "version": "1",
  "name": "Ink",
  "author": "Jeff Bishop",
  "description": "Crisp synthesised earcons for focused writing.",
  "license": "CC0",
  "events": { "abbreviation_expanded": "expand.wav", "document_saved": "save.wav" }
}
```

Any event key absent from the manifest is silently skipped (no sound, no error), which allows minimal **partial packs** that cover only a subset of events. The QSP schema places no constraint on event-key names, so a Quillin can register additional event IDs and ship its own pack.

#### 5.70.2 Event taxonomy

Canonical event IDs are defined as a `StrEnum` in `quill/core/sound_events.py` (no `wx`, no platform code). Groups: **Editing** (`abbreviation_expanded`, `abbreviation_deleted`, `snippet_inserted`, `autocomplete_accepted`, `word_corrected`), **Document lifecycle** (`document_created/saved/closed`), **Navigation** (`heading_jumped`, `table_entered`, `list_entered`, `browse_mode_on/off`), **Search** (`search_found/not_found/wrapped`), **AI and transcription** (`ai_thinking_started`, `ai_response_received`, `ai_error`, `transcription_started/stopped/word_inserted`), **Connectivity** (`ssh_connected/disconnected`), **Compare** (`compare_enter_mode`, `compare_exit_mode`, `compare_next_difference`, `compare_previous_difference`, `compare_no_more_differences`), **Indentation tones** (`indent_level_0..7_up` / `_down`), and **System** (`error`, `warning`, `sound_on`, `sound_off`). The complete table with triggers is maintained in this section's source and surfaced to pack authors via the Sound Events dialog.

#### 5.70.3 Audio file requirements

- Format: **WAV** (PCM, 16-bit, 44100 Hz, mono) — plays from memory with no decode step, the key to zero-lag earcons.
- Duration: earcons 50–150 ms; state-change sounds (browse mode, SSH) up to 300 ms; nothing longer.
- Headroom: normalize to about −6 dBFS so the volume control stays meaningful.
- OGG/MP3 are not accepted for core events because codec init adds 20–80 ms of jitter on first play.
- Every scripted earcon in a bundled pack must be **acoustically unique** — no two events share an identical sound (audited byte-wise and by manifest mapping).

#### 5.70.4 Cross-platform backend

`quill/platform/sound_player.py` auto-detects the best backend at startup: (1) `_SoundLibBackend` (BASS via the MIT-licensed `accessibleapps/sound_lib`, all platforms, native mixing); (2) `_WinsoundBackend` (Windows stdlib, serialising queue); (3) `_NSSoundBackend` (AppKit `NSSound` via `pyobjc`, macOS fallback); (4) `_NullBackend`. `sound_lib` is an optional, licensed extra (`pip install quill[audio]`) never bundled by default; absent it, QUILL falls back to `winsound` on Windows or `NSSound` on macOS (both ship with their respective build extras already) before going silent. Any object satisfying the `_WavBackend` protocol (`play_wav(bytes)`, `shutdown(timeout)`) can be injected, which is how tests use a synchronous recording backend.

#### 5.70.5 Module layout and posting

`sound_events.py` (enum) → `sound_pack.py` (QSP loader + validator; reads every WAV into bytes at load, zero disk I/O at play time) → `sound_player.py` (`SoundPlayer`: 80 ms per-event cooldown, mute toggle, per-event disable list) → `quill/ui/sound_manager.py` (singleton wired to settings and a custom wx event). Any module posts a sound without importing `wx`:

```python
from quill.core.sound_events import SoundEvent
from quill.ui.sound_manager import post_sound
post_sound(SoundEvent.ABBREVIATION_EXPANDED)   # thread-safe, < 1 ms, no-op if disabled
```

#### 5.70.6 Indentation tones and overlay packs

For code, an **indent-tone pack** maps the 16 `indent_level_N_up/down` events to pitched tones so the caret crossing indent levels rises and falls in pitch. Four scales ship — pentatonic, whole-tone, diatonic, chromatic — generated by `scripts/gen_indent_tones.py`. An indent-tone pack **overlays** a primary earcon pack, so the user can combine, say, the Ink earcons with pentatonic indent tones. The `indent_tone_scale` setting (empty = off) selects the scale; blank lines stay silent and hold the previous level.

#### 5.70.7 Settings, packs, and Quillins

Settings (group `accessibility`): `sound_enabled` (bool), `sound_pack_path` (text; empty = bundled **Ink** pack), `sound_volume` (0–100), `sound_events_disabled` (comma-separated IDs), `indent_tone_scale` (choice). A global mute is bound to the `sound.toggle_mute` keymap action. The bundled **Ink** pack ships in the wheel at `quill/assets/sound_packs/ink/` (generated by `scripts/gen_ink_sounds.py`). A Quillin manifest may declare a `sound_pack` directory and `sound_events` map; the runner registers those IDs with `SoundManager` at load time, and the user can silence them individually via `sound_events_disabled`.

#### 5.70.8 Safe mode

When `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1`, `SoundPlayer.play()` is a no-op, keeping safe mode strictly minimal-resource.

### 5.70a Post to Mastodon (lean poster)

A deliberately small way to publish a status to Mastodon from the editor — not a full client (no timelines, replies, media, or polls in v1).

- **Compose flow.** `tools.post_to_mastodon` (default **QUILL Key + Shift+P**, also **Tools → Share → Post to Mastodon...**) takes the editor selection, or the whole document when nothing is selected, and opens `MastodonComposeDialog`: editable text, an account picker (by nickname), a visibility choice (public/unlisted/private/direct), a live character count, and Post. Disabled in Safe Mode. If no account exists, the accounts manager is offered first, then compose continues if one was added.
- **Accounts.** `tools.manage_mastodon_accounts` opens `MastodonAccountsDialog` (add/remove/set-default). Adding registers an app named **QUILL** on the user's instance (so posts read "via QUILL") and uses the OAuth out-of-band flow: open the browser to authorize, paste the code back. Non-secret metadata (nickname, instance, `@handle`, client id) is stored in `mastodon-accounts.json`; the access token and client secret go to the Windows Credential Manager / DPAPI via `credential_store`, never the JSON.
- **Post language and per-instance character limit (#922).** `post_status` accepts an optional `language` (an ISO 639-1 code such as `"en"` or `"it"`); when given it is sent as the post's `language` field so the instance files the post under the right language preset instead of the account's default, and `None` omits the field. The compose dialog exposes this as a **Post language** `wx.Choice` next to visibility; the first entry ("Default (instance)") maps to `None`, the rest send their code. The live counter uses `instance_character_limit(instance_url)`, which fetches `GET /api/v2/instance`, reads `configuration.statuses.max_characters`, and falls back to `DEFAULT_CHARACTER_LIMIT`; the result is cached in-process per normalized instance URL (`clear_character_limit_cache` is the test hook) so the counter reflects an instance like one with a 9999-character limit without re-querying on every keystroke. `LANGUAGES` in `mastodon_dialogs.py` lists the presets, "Default (instance)" first.
- **Implementation.** All API + account logic is wx-free in `quill/core/mastodon/` — `client.py` (a single audited `urllib` egress site `_http_json`, HTTPS-only over a verified TLS context: app registration, OAuth token exchange, `verify_credentials`, status post, and the `GET /api/v2/instance` character-limit lookup) and `accounts.py`. Dialogs in `quill/ui/mastodon_dialogs.py`. The egress sites are recorded in `network_egress_audit.py`.

### 5.71 Quiet mode

- `View → Quiet Mode` (`Ctrl+Alt+Q` by default) is a single toggle that:
  - hides the status bar (still reachable via F6 announcement only),
  - suppresses non-critical announcements (autosave summary, idle-prefetch chatter, Tip of the Day),
  - sets audio cues volume to zero for the session,
  - leaves all critical announcements intact (errors, save failures, AI completion).
- Announced on toggle (`Quiet mode on` / `off`).
- Useful for high-focus writing sessions; state is per-session and not persisted.

### 5.72 Temporary trust for untrusted-location opens

- The Trusted Locations prompt (5.31) gains a third button: **Open this time only**.
- The file opens; the folder is **not** added to trusted locations.
- Useful for one-off opens from Downloads or temp folders without expanding the trust footprint.

### 5.73 Settings search

- A search field at the top of the Settings dialog (`Ctrl+F` when focus is in Settings).
- Indexes setting key, label, description, and a synonym list maintained alongside each setting.
- As the user types, the tree filters to matching settings; the first match is announced.
- `Esc` clears the filter; `Tab` moves to the tree.
- The synonym list is gettext-translated alongside labels.

### 5.74 In-app changelog and update transparency

- `Help → Release Notes` opens a Markdown document with one section per version. Auto-generated from `CHANGELOG.md` at build time.
- The manual update dialog (5.34, 10.12) links to the release notes for the version it is offering, shows the published date when the feed provides it, and lets the user **Skip this version**, **Download**, or decide **Later**.
- Past release notes remain reachable through the document's own outline (5.16).

### 5.75 Crash-report opt-in (per recovery)

- When Quill recovers from a crash, the recovery dialog includes an opt-in checkbox: **Send crash details to the Quill team (no document content)**.
- If checked, the diagnostics bundle (5.33) is uploaded over HTTPS to a host shown explicitly in the dialog before send; the upload is cancellable and shows a progress announcement.
- Off by default; the choice is **remembered per recovery session only**, never globally — this prevents accidental long-term opt-in.
- Crash reports include logs, environment, and the last 50 commands, never document content or API keys.

### 5.76 Interactive compare mode

Quill provides two complementary comparison workflows: an accessible interactive compare session and a generated diff report.

- **Compare commands** (`Tools → Comparison`): `Compare with File…`, `Compare Open Documents…`, `Next Difference`, `Previous Difference`, `Announce Current Difference`, `Difference List…`, `Toggle Synchronized Navigation`, `Compare Options…`, `Create Difference Summary`, `Copy Current Difference`, `Copy All Differences`. A `Navigate → Compare` submenu carries the same commands under the `tools.compare_*` ids.
- **Core navigation** (`Navigate → Compare`, post-#357 chord class): `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.` next difference, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+,` previous difference, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D` read current difference. The Difference List and Toggle Synchronized Navigation have no default key; assign them in the Keymap Editor.
- **Interactive session**: focus stays in the active editor; moving to a difference places the cursor on the changed line and announces both sides in plain language.
- **Difference List**: a stock list control containing all differences with document names, line numbers, type, and a short preview; Enter jumps to the selected difference.
- **Compare options**: ignore leading/trailing spaces, all whitespace, blank lines, line endings, case, punctuation, repeated spaces, Markdown heading markers, HTML tag differences, and normalized Unicode.
- **Difference summary**: users may create a plain-text summary document listing all differences, options used, and short before/after excerpts.
- **Diff report**: Quill may also generate a unified-diff document in a new editor tab. Diff hunks remain navigable with `Ctrl+]` and `Ctrl+[`.
- **Extracted document compare**: PDF, DOCX, EPUB, OCR, and repaired text compare against Quill’s extracted text representation, with a warning that extraction quality may affect results.
- **Feature profiles**: interactive compare is on in Casual Writer, Author or Student, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, and Full Quill; it is quiet in Essential.

### 5.58 Ask Quill — on-device AI chat (WebView)

Ask Quill is a conversational assistant that runs entirely on the user's machine — no cloud, no API keys. It can answer questions, write or rewrite text for the document, and run Quill commands, but it is screen-reader-first and approval-gated: nothing touches the document until the user approves it. This is the crawl-before-run 1.0 surface; a deeper native integration is future work.

**On-device backends (platform-selected).** `make_default_backend()` picks the backend by platform — Apple Foundation Models on macOS, and **llama.cpp (`llama-cpp-python`, CPU, GGUF)** on Windows and Linux. There is no server and no GPU requirement. On Windows the model runs in-process on the CPU.

- **Model manager (RAM-tiered, auto-download).** On first use the backend resolves a model: `QUILL_LLAMA_MODEL` (explicit `.gguf` path) → an existing `*.gguf` in `<app data>/models` → otherwise it downloads the RAM-appropriate model with progress announced. Machines under ~8 GB RAM get **Llama 3.2 1B**; otherwise **Phi-4-mini (Q4)**.
- **Model is a setting, not a chore.** The model choice is exposed in the AI Model settings dialog (dropdown + Download Now) and during onboarding — users are never asked to "drop a GGUF." Onboarding first asks **"Do you want to use AI?"**; the model controls only appear if they say yes. Model descriptions avoid em-dashes.
- **Graceful CPU fallback.** If the prebuilt llama.cpp hits an unsupported CPU instruction (`STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION 0xC000001D` — e.g. AVX2 missing under x64-on-ARM emulation such as Parallels on Apple Silicon), the backend converts the `OSError` into a plain-language message explaining that the CPU lacks AVX2 and suggesting a no-AVX / native build, instead of crashing.

**The whole chat lives in a WebView (Edge WebView2 on Windows).** Transcript, suggestions, _and the message edit field_ are all rendered as HTML in `wx.html2.WebView` — which is **Edge WebView2** on Windows (WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux). We deliberately render in the WebView rather than a plain list box + separate text field because it gives us formatted Markdown (the assistant's headings, lists, and code render properly) together with the browser engine's native, mature accessibility, and keeps the user in one place. `wx.html2.WebView` is a factory-created native control and cannot be meaningfully subclassed, so accessibility is driven by the **HTML we render**, via a thin wrapper (`AccessibleWebView`):

- An **ARIA live region** (`<main role="log" aria-live="polite">`) so each new message is announced automatically by NVDA / JAWS / Narrator without the user moving focus.
- An assertive `role="status"` region for transient state ("Quill is responding", "Quill responded").
- Each message is an `<article>` with a heading (the speaker), so users can navigate the transcript by heading.
- **The edit field is in the page** — a labelled `<textarea>` with a Send button. Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Submissions post back to Python over a **script-message bridge** (`window.quill.postMessage` ↔ `EVT_WEBVIEW_SCRIPT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED`) which drives the on-device assistant directly. The wx text field only appears in the list-box fallback when no WebView backend exists.
- **Suggested prompts disappear after the first message** (like Apple Intelligence): they show on open so the user has a starting point, then hide themselves once the conversation begins so they never sit in the way of the chat.
- `lang`, viewport, readable type, and high-contrast / `forced-colors` CSS.
- The greeting is **baked into the initial page** so there is no "empty then rendered" flash on open. Messages and state changes that arrive before the page finishes loading are queued and replayed on the `LOADED` event.

**Focus lands in the web view's edit field on open (screen-reader behavior).** When the chat opens, focus is moved directly into the in-page message field (`AccessibleWebView.focus()` → focuses the `<textarea>`, via `wx.CallAfter`) rather than onto surrounding chrome — so the user "jumps into the web view" ready to type, and the screen reader starts inside the live conversation. After a reply we do **not** steal focus back (the live region already announced it); after an approval we return focus to the edit field. (Implemented in `AskQuillChatDialog.show()` / `_focus_composer()`.)

**Prism announcements (screen-reader-first).** In addition to the WebView's ARIA live region, Quill uses the **Prism (`prismatoid`) bridge on Windows** to send response text straight to the active screen reader, so the user hears new replies even without alt-tabbing to the chat. Prism never speaks over a running screen reader — its SAPI 5 self-voicing fallback is suppressed whenever a screen reader is detected.

**Approval before anything is applied.** Each turn the assistant _decides_ (`answer` / `insert` / `replace` / `run`) but never edits the document automatically. Insert/replace text and command runs are shown as a proposal with an Approve / Discard bar; focus moves to **Approve** and the screen reader is told a change is proposed. Only on Approve does Quill insert, replace the selection, or run the command. There is also Copy Last Response and labeled suggestion prompts.

**Discoverability and reliability.** Ask Quill lives under a top-level **AI** menu (Alt+I) alongside the "Use Artificial Intelligence" toggle and AI Model settings. Generation runs off the UI thread. The single-instance lock self-heals (PID + creation-time identity) so a stale lock from a crash never blocks launch.

### 5.77 Copy Tray — twelve-slot persistent clipboard

Copy Tray gives users twelve independently addressable clipboard slots that survive application restarts. Each slot holds text explicitly placed there; slots are written atomically to disk on every change.

**Motivation.** The system clipboard holds one item and is shared across every running application. Screen-reader users who work across multiple documents, do research from multiple sources, or paste recurring fragments (signatures, disclaimers, code boilerplate) lose clipboard contents constantly because any copy from any app overwrites it. Copy Tray is a private, persistent alternative.

**Core operations.**

- **Copy to slot N** — copies the current selection to slot N (1–12). Reports the slot number, optional label, and a text preview through the screen-reader bridge.
- **Paste from slot N** — inserts the slot's text at the cursor (or replaces the selection). Reports slot number and label. Supports multi-press: single=paste, double=peek, triple=open dialog.
- **Copy to Next Empty Slot** (`edit.copy_to_next_slot`) — copies the selection to the first unoccupied, unpinned slot in order 1–12. Announces which slot was used. If all slots are occupied, announces this rather than silently overwriting.
- **Search Tray Slots** (`edit.search_tray_slots`) — opens a minimal search dialog. User types a query; QUILL searches all slot text and labels and announces matches. The user can press a digit key to paste that slot directly.
- **Open Copy Tray dialog** — shows all twelve slots with slot number, optional label, and a text preview. Inline editing of content and label; auto-save on slot change. Includes Pin/Unpin button.
- **Set label** — names a slot with a short string. Labels are spoken in all subsequent announcements, visible in the dialog, and shown in the Paste from Tray submenu alongside a text preview.
- **Pin / Unpin** — marks a slot as pinned from the dialog. Pinned slots are never overwritten by next-empty routing and are announced with a "pinned" prefix.
- **Clear All Tray Slots** — empties all twelve slots after a Yes/No confirmation defaulting to No.

**Multi-press paste.** The paste chord supports three levels of intent:

| Press count | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Single | Paste slot content at cursor |
| Double | Peek: announce slot content without pasting |
| Triple | Open Copy Tray dialog focused on that slot |

The press window is configurable via `multi_press_window_ms` (default 400 ms, range 100–1000 ms; found in `App > Preferences > Editing`). This lets expert users check what a slot holds before committing — useful for a crowded tray where memory may be unreliable.

**Paste submenu slot labels.** The `Edit > Copy Tray > Paste from Tray` menu shows each slot's label and a text preview inline (e.g. "1  signature — Hi, I wanted to follow..."). Screen readers read both columns when navigating the submenu.

**Status bar cell.** The `copy_tray_slots` status bar cell shows `Slots: X/12` (occupied count). Clicking it opens the Copy Tray dialog.

**Keyboard defaults.**

| Action | Default binding |
| --- | --- |
| Paste from slot 1–9 | `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+9` |
| Paste from slot 10 | `Ctrl+Shift+0` |
| Paste from slot 11 | `Ctrl+Shift+-` |
| Paste from slot 12 | `Ctrl+Shift+=` |
| Copy to slot 1–9 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+9` |
| Copy to slot 10 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+0` |
| Copy to slot 11 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+-` |
| Copy to slot 12 | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+=` |
| Open Copy Tray dialog | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, X` |

The paste bindings use the number row directly for maximum speed. The copy bindings use the QUILL-key prefix to distinguish from heading shortcuts. All bindings are reassignable via the Keymap Editor.

**Storage.** `copy_tray.json` in the QUILL user data directory. Atomic write (`os.replace`). Version-tagged JSON; corrupt files fail silently (fresh state, no crash).

**Accessibility guarantees.** Every operation announces through the screen-reader bridge: "Copied to slot 1", "Pasted from slot 3 (signature)", "Slot 5 is empty", "Slot 2: by the way" (peek). The dialog list receives focus on open. Empty and non-empty slots are announced distinctly. The clear-all confirmation defaults to No.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/copy_tray.py` (pure model, mypy-clean; `TraySlot` with `pinned` field, `pin_slot`, `unpin_slot`, `first_empty_slot`, `search_slots`), `quill/core/multi_press.py` (MultiPressDispatcher, wx-free), `quill/ui/main_frame_copy_tray.py` (mixin: multi-press wiring, `copy_to_next_slot`, `search_tray_slots`, `_TraySearchDialog`, `_update_paste_tray_labels`), `quill/ui/copy_tray_dialog.py` (dialog with Pin/Unpin button), `quill/core/keymap.py` (24 slot commands + 4 management commands). Menu: `Edit > Copy Tray` submenu including "Copy to Next Empty Slot" and "Search Tray Slots...".

### 5.78 Abbreviation Expansion — TextExpander-style bare-word shortcuts

Abbreviation Expansion replaces short trigger words with longer text automatically as you type, **when enabled** (it ships **off by default** so nothing changes under the user's hands unannounced). It complements the snippet system (which requires an explicit trigger prefix) by firing on any bare word followed by a delimiter.

**Motivation.** Typing common phrases repeatedly is fatiguing and slow. TextExpander and similar tools are widely used but require separate purchase and licensing. QUILL's built-in abbreviation engine gives screen-reader users the same productivity gain with no external dependency and full keyboard control over every setting.

**How it works.** When the user types a trigger word (e.g. `btw`) followed by any delimiter character — space, period, comma, semicolon, colon, exclamation mark, question mark, closing bracket, closing brace, tab, or newline — QUILL:

1. Detects the trigger at the cursor.
2. Looks up the trigger in the library (longest match first; case-insensitive by default).
3. Replaces the trigger with the expanded text.
4. Positions the cursor as specified (at `${cursor}` if present, otherwise after the expansion).
5. Optionally plays a configured sound.
6. Announces the expansion through the screen-reader bridge.

**Default library.** Fifteen built-in abbreviations ship out-of-the-box: `afaik` → as far as I know, `afaict` → as far as I can tell, `asap` → as soon as possible, `atm` → at the moment, `btw` → by the way, `fwiw` → for what it's worth, `imo` → in my opinion, `imho` → in my humble opinion, `irl` → in real life, `omw` → on my way, `tbh` → to be honest, `tbc` → to be confirmed, `tbd` → to be determined, `ttyl` → talk to you later, `wrt` → with regard to. These are declared as `_BUILTINS` in `abbreviations.py`.

**Variables.** Expansion bodies support:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `${cursor}` | Cursor position after expansion |
| `${date}` | Current date (e.g. June 11, 2026) |
| `${time}` | Current time (12-hour, e.g. 02:30 PM) |
| `${clipboard}` | System clipboard text at expansion time |

**Keyboard defaults.**

| Action | Default binding |
| --- | --- |
| Expand abbreviation at cursor (manual) | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A` |
| Manage Abbreviations... | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, Shift+A` |
| Toggle expansion on/off | `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, E` |

**Settings.** Four settings in `Editing` preferences:

- `abbreviation_expansion` (bool, default **False**) — master on/off. Off by default so text never auto-changes as the user types without their knowledge; the user opts in and the choice is then remembered.
- `abbreviation_expansion_sound` (bool, default False) — play a sound on expansion.
- `abbreviation_expansion_sound_file` (text) — path to a `.wav` file; blank = system default beep.
- `multi_press_window_ms` (int, default 400, range 100–1000) — time window for double/triple press detection across all multi-press chords (copy tray peek, command palette re-run, etc.).

**Status bar.** The `abbreviations` status bar cell shows `ABR: On` or `ABR: Off`. Clicking it toggles expansion. Hidden by default; add via status bar settings.

**Storage.** `abbreviations.json` in the QUILL user data directory. Atomic write. Default library written on first launch if file is absent.

**Interaction with snippets.** Abbreviation expansion fires before snippet expansion in `_on_text_changed`. If an abbreviation match is found, snippet expansion is skipped for that keystroke. The `;`-prefix snippet trigger is disjoint from bare-word abbreviation triggers so conflicts are practically impossible.

**Accessibility guarantees.** Every expansion announces "Expanded: \<preview\>" through the screen-reader bridge. Manual trigger (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, A`) announces "Expanded to: \<preview\>" or "No abbreviation match". Toggle announces "Abbreviation expansion on/off".

**Abbreviation Manager dialog.** `quill/ui/abbreviation_manager_dialog.py` — A11Y-4 compliant, registered in the dialog inventory. Features: search field (filters the list in real time), Import button (merges a JSON file, skips duplicate IDs, announces count), Export button (saves full library to a JSON file). Disabled abbreviations shown with "(disabled)" suffix.

**`AbbreviationLibrary` class API** (all methods on `quill/core/abbreviations.AbbreviationLibrary`):

- `add(abbr, expansion, **kwargs) -> Abbreviation` — adds a new abbreviation, generates a UUID.
- `remove(id) -> None` — removes by ID.
- `enable(id) / disable(id) -> None` — toggle without deletion.
- `update(id, **fields) -> Abbreviation` — updates one or more fields; uses `object.__setattr__` for `slots=True` dataclass.
- `all() -> list[Abbreviation]` — full library in insert order.
- `enabled_only() -> list[Abbreviation]` — only enabled entries.
- `find_by_trigger(text, case_sensitive) -> Abbreviation | None` — looks up by trigger word.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/abbreviations.py` (pure model, mypy-clean: `Abbreviation` dataclass, `AbbreviationLibrary`, `try_expand`, `resolve_expansion`, `_BUILTINS`), `quill/ui/main_frame_abbreviations.py` (`AbbreviationsMixin`), `quill/ui/abbreviation_manager_dialog.py` (management dialog with search + import/export). Menu: `Insert > Expand Abbreviation`, `Insert > Manage Abbreviations...`, `Insert > Toggle Abbreviation Expansion`.

### 5.78a Quillin-contributed insert automation — abbreviations and smart triggers

Quillins declare two Insert Automation contribution types in their manifests (`contributes.abbreviations`, `contributes.smart_triggers`); QUILL dispatches both.

**Contributed abbreviations.** At Quillin load, `abbreviations.build_contributed_library` merges every installed manifest's *static* abbreviation entries (those with an `expansion`) into a separate in-memory `AbbreviationLibrary` — deterministic namespaced ids (`quillin:<id>:<trigger>`), rebuilt on every reload, **never persisted** into the user's `abbreviations.json`. Handler-based entries (e.g. Smart Insert's `qbrf`) are skipped: the bare-word expander cannot run a handler mid-type, so dynamic content is reached via a smart trigger or menu command instead. Expansion order: the user's own library is tried first, the contributed library only on a miss, so a user abbreviation always beats a contributed one with the same trigger; across Quillins, first-loaded wins. Each entry honours the Quillin's own `enable_abbrev_<trigger>` setting (default: the manifest's `enabled_by_default`), and the global Abbreviation Expansion master toggle gates everything. Core: `quill/core/abbreviations.py`; host wiring: `main_frame_quillins.py` (build) + `main_frame_abbreviations.py` (`_try_expand_contributed`). Unit-tested in `tests/unit/core/test_abbreviations_contributed.py`.

**Smart triggers (`=name(args)`).** A smart trigger is a line that is exactly `=name(arg, arg)` (whitespace-tolerant) activated with Enter. The parser (`quill/core/quillins/smart_triggers.py`, pure/wx-free, unit-tested) requires the trigger to occupy the whole line and a name-then-parens shape, so prose containing `=foo()`, a bare `=5`, or spreadsheet-style `=a+b` never fires. Arguments are comma-separated, stripped, empties dropped. Resolution checks: name known (index across installed manifests, first definition wins on collision), trigger enabled (per-Quillin `enable_<name>` setting; non-bundled commands also require the SEC-8 third-party flag), and declared `min_args`/`max_args` bounds. On dispatch the editor removes the trigger line, runs the linked command at that position with a context of `{"trigger", "args"}` (handlers receive the args — e.g. `=todo(10)` builds a ten-item list, `=rand(3,4)` three paragraphs of four lines, both clamped to sane maxima), and fires the `smart_trigger.entered` Quillin event with the same payload. A disabled or unknown trigger leaves the line untouched and Enter behaves normally. Host wiring: `MainFrame._handle_smart_trigger_return` (Enter interception, before Markdown list continuation) → `QuillinsMenuMixin.dispatch_smart_trigger_line`.

### 5.79 Ask AI — lightweight in-editor AI chat

> **Retired in 2.0 (see §5.84a).** Ask AI has been folded into the single
> context-aware **Ask Quill** conversation; the standalone dialog and its command
> were removed so there is one chat door. This section is retained for history.

Ask AI is a modal dialog that lets users send a prompt to a configured AI provider and read the response without leaving QUILL. No document text is changed; the dialog is purely informational.

**Motivation.** Screen-reader users frequently need to ask a quick question while writing — define a term, check a fact, explore a phrasing option — and switching to a browser or a separate AI client breaks flow, especially when using NVDA or JAWS where switching applications involves extra navigation. Ask AI keeps the interaction entirely within the QUILL keyboard model.

**Entry point.** `AI > Ask AI...` (Command Palette) and `AI > Writing Assistant...` (`Alt+Q` default chord). The Command Palette entry is "Ask AI". The binding is user-reassignable.

**Providers.** Three providers are supported. QUILL detects which keys are configured and only shows available providers.

| Provider | Auth | Model discovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenRouter | API key (DPAPI-encrypted) | `GET /api/v1/models`, cached per session |
| OpenAI | API key (DPAPI-encrypted) | `GET /v1/models`, filtered to `gpt-*`/`o*` families |
| Ollama | None (local) | `GET /api/tags`; greyed out if service not running |

**Smart focus.** When the dialog opens, focus lands in the Prompt field if the provider and model are already configured. If not yet configured, focus starts on the Provider choice so the user is guided to set it up first.

**Dialog layout.**

```
Provider:  [OpenRouter v]
Model:     [claude-3-5-sonnet v]
Prompt:    [multiline — Ctrl+Enter to send]
[Send]  [Clear]  [Close]
```

The response opens in a separate read-only dialog (model label at top, scrollable text area, Copy to Clipboard, Close). Closing the response dialog returns focus to the Ask AI dialog so the user can ask a follow-up without reopening.

**Settings** (in `Preferences > AI`):

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_chat_default_provider` | str | `"openrouter"` | Last-used provider |
| `ai_chat_default_model` | str | `""` | Last-used model |
| `ollama_base_url` | str | `"http://localhost:11434"` | Ollama endpoint (override for remote Ollama) |

**Keys stored in Windows Credential Manager** (never in `settings.json`): `quill-openrouter-api-key`, `quill-openai-api-key`.

**Safe Mode.** The Ask AI menu item and dialog are disabled when `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1`.

**Network egress.** Audited in `network_egress_audit.py`: `openrouter_chat`, `openai_chat`, `ollama_chat`, `openrouter_models`, `openai_models`, `ollama_models`. Timeout: 60 s for chat, 10 s for model list.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/ai_chat.py` (provider abstraction: `send_prompt`, `list_models`), `quill/ui/ai_chat_dialog.py` (Ask AI dialog + AI Response dialog, A11Y-4 hardened, registered in dialog inventory).

### 5.80 Check Grammar with AI

Check Grammar with AI sends the current selection (or full document if nothing is selected) to the configured AI model with a grammar-review prompt and displays the result in the AI Response dialog. No edits are applied automatically.

**Entry point.** `Edit > Grammar > Check Grammar with AI`. Command Palette: "Check Grammar with AI". User-assignable binding; no default chord.

**Default prompt.**

```
You are a grammar and style editor. Review the following text and list
only the corrections needed. For each correction, give: the original
phrase, the corrected phrase, and a one-sentence reason. Do not rewrite
the whole passage. If the text is correct, say "No issues found."

Text:
{selection}
```

When Phase 3 (§5.81) is active, the command uses the user's "Check Grammar" prompt from the Prompt Library instead, so the instruction text is fully customisable.

**Model selection.** Uses `settings.ai_prompt_default_model` when set, otherwise falls back to `settings.ai_chat_default_model`. This lets users choose a different (e.g. more capable) model for grammar review than for casual chat.

**Implementation.** Single method `check_grammar_with_ai()` in `MainFrame`. Runs on a background thread (`threading.Thread`, daemon=True); UI updates via `wx.CallAfter`. Command id: `tools.check_grammar_ai`.

---

### 5.81 AI Prompt Library

The Prompt Library is a named, user-expandable collection of AI instructions. Each prompt operates on the current selection or document: the user picks a prompt, QUILL sends the text and the prompt to the AI, and a response dialog shows the result. No document text changes without explicit action.

**Motivation.** Power users accumulate a personal set of AI instructions they run repeatedly — improve clarity, vary sentence rhythm, convert to bullets, generate an outline. Without a library, these prompts must be retyped or pasted from an external file each time. The Prompt Library turns these into first-class named commands, accessible from the keyboard, the command palette, and the dialog.

**Entry point.** `AI > Prompt Library...`. Command Palette: "Prompt Library". User-assignable binding.

**Prompt object fields.**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Short display name ("Improve clarity") |
| `text` | Instruction text, with `{selection}`, `{document}`, `{title}` variables |
| `category` | Editing, Writing, Structure, Research, or Custom |
| `is_builtin` | True for shipped defaults — editable but not deletable |
| `id` | UUID, stable across renames |
| `shortcut` | Optional keyboard chord bound to this prompt |
| `enabled` | False to hide from menus without deleting |
| `source` | "builtin", "user", or Quillin id |

**Built-in prompts (12).** Shipped defaults, always present, user-editable:

- Editing: Check Grammar, Improve Clarity, Fix Grammar, Make Concise, Active Voice, Formal Tone, Conversational Tone
- Writing: Continue from Here
- Structure: Convert to Bullet Points
- Research: Define This Term, Find Counterarguments
- Custom: (none shipped; user-created)

**Prompt Library Dialog.** Split layout: left panel shows a searchable list of all prompts (filtered by the search field in real time); right panel shows the selected prompt's text and an optional input override. Buttons: Run with AI, New Prompt, Edit, Disable/Enable, Delete, Import .pqp, Export .pqp, Close. A11Y-4 hardened, registered in the dialog inventory.

**Settings.**

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_prompt_default_model` | str | `""` | Model used for prompt runs. Blank inherits `ai_chat_default_model`. |

**Storage.** `%APPDATA%\Quill\prompts.json` — atomic write, schema-validated. Built-in prompts are not persisted; only user additions and overrides to built-ins are stored.

**Quillin bridge.** A Quillin may ship a `prompts.json` file alongside its manifest. QUILL loads it automatically when the Prompt Library opens, adding those prompts to the library for the session (not persisted to disk). The bundled `ai-writing-prompts` Quillin ships 7 additional prompts this way: Expand This, Vary Sentence Rhythm, Make More Vivid (Writing); Write a Title, Generate Outline (Structure); Suggest Supporting Evidence (Research); Plain Language (Editing).

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/prompt_library.py` (`Prompt` dataclass, `PromptLibrary` CRUD, `.pqp` import/export, Quillin prompt loading), `quill/ui/prompt_library_dialog.py` (Prompt Library dialog), `quill/quillins_bundled/ai-writing-prompts/` (bundled prompt pack).

---

### 5.82 Prompt Quill Pack (.pqp) — shareable prompt collections

A `.pqp` (Prompt Quill Pack) file is a JSON document that packages a named collection of prompts for sharing or backup.

**File format.**

```json
{
  "schema": "quill.prompt-pack/1",
  "name": "My Writing Prompts",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "Make Punchy",
      "text": "Rewrite this as a punchy one-liner: {selection}",
      "category": "Editing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Import.** Via the Import .pqp button in the Prompt Library dialog. Prompts whose name already exists in the library are skipped; the count of newly added prompts is announced.

**Export.** Via the Export .pqp button. Exports all user-defined prompts (or a selected subset). Built-in prompts can optionally be included when the user has edited them.

**Use case.** A writing team can share a `.pqp` file containing their house-style prompts. A power user can back up their library and restore it on a new machine. A Quillin author can distribute prompts as a `.pqp` for users who prefer not to install a Quillin.

### 5.83 Quillin Manager — install, update, and remove extensions

The Quillin Manager (`Tools > Quillins`) lets users discover, enable, disable, and uninstall Quillins. As of this version it also supports installing a new Quillin directly from a local folder.

**Install from Folder.** The Install from Folder button opens a system folder picker. QUILL reads the selected folder's `manifest.json`, validates it, copies the directory into the per-user extensions root (`%APPDATA%\Quill\extensions\<id>\`), enables the Quillin, and refreshes the list. If an extension with the same id is already installed, it is replaced. Path containment is enforced: a crafted extension id cannot install files outside the extensions root.

**Remove.** Selecting an extension and pressing Remove deletes its directory and removes its state entry. Confirmation is required.

**Enable/Disable.** Toggle without uninstalling. A disabled Quillin's prompts and commands are not loaded.

**Manifest display.** Selecting a Quillin shows its name, version, author, description, declared capabilities, and any validation errors. This gives users the information they need to make an informed trust decision before enabling.

**Security model (SEC-8).** Third-party Quillin *discovery* (auto-scanning the extensions root) is locked off for QUILL 1.0 (`core.third_party_plugins` feature flag is `locked_off`). Install from Folder is the only way to add a third-party Quillin. The user must explicitly choose the folder, providing informed consent equivalent to "install this extension". Bundled Quillins (shipped inside the QUILL install tree) are always discovered and are not affected by the SEC-8 lock.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/quillins/loader.py` (`install_extension`, `remove_extension`, `set_enabled`), `quill/ui/main_frame_quillins.py` (`QuillinsManagerMixin` — manager panel, Install from Folder button and handler).

### 5.83a The Quillin Hub — community distribution for every shareable artifact

The Quillin Hub (`hub.quillforall.org`; service code in `quillin-hub/`) is the community store and submission surface for **every** shareable QUILL artifact type, not just Quillin extensions. Seven artifact families are accepted for review and publication:

| Type id | Artifact | Format | Authoritative validator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quillin` | Quillin extension | directory / .zip with `manifest.json` | `quill.tools.quillin_lint` |
| `agent` | AI agent (`quill.agent/1`) | `.md` / `.json` | `quill.tools.agent_lint` |
| `verbosity-pack` | Verbosity pack | `.qvp.json` | `quill.core.verbosity.qvp` |
| `sound-pack` | QSP sound pack | `.qsp` ZIP or directory | `quill.core.sound_pack` |
| `keyboard-pack` | Keyboard Quill Pack | `.kqp` | `quill.tools.kqp_validator` |
| `skill-pack` | Skill Quill Pack | `.sqp` | `quill.tools.sqp_validator` |
| `pronunciation-dictionary` | Pronunciation dictionary | `.json` | pronunciation schema check |

**One validation authority.** `python -m quill.tools.artifact_validate <path> [--type ID] [--strict] [--json]` detects the artifact type (by suffix, manifest sniffing, or schema markers) and dispatches to the per-type validator listed above. The Hub's Submission Forge, CI, and the in-app submission check all run this same tool, so an author never sees three different verdicts. Exit codes follow the validator convention (0 pass, 1 issues, 2 not found/undetectable); `--json` emits the machine-readable report the Forge consumes.

**The Submission Forge.** The Hub's `/forge/submit` flow accepts any supported file, auto-detects the type (with a manual override), and runs a three-stage audit: (1) `artifact_validate` validation; (2) for Quillins only, a Bandit scan plus the AST `SecurityWatchdog` capability-honesty check (undeclared `fs`/`net`/`stability` imports and `eval`/`exec` fail the submission); (3) metadata extraction from the artifact's own manifest or front matter so authors never retype name/version/description. The result is an accessible plain-language Forge Report; publication itself stays GitHub-native (a guided pull request), keeping review transparent.

**Registry API.** `/api/v1/types`, `/api/v1/artifacts[?type=…]`, and `/api/v1/artifacts/<id>/latest` serve the verified catalog to clients; the original `/api/v1/plugins` endpoints remain as Quillin-only aliases. A sync worker mirrors artifacts that land on `main` (bundled/example Quillins, catalog agents, bundled `.sqp` skills) into the storefront as Verified.

**In-app tie-in.** **Tools > Quillins > Submit to Quillin Hub...** (`tools.quillin_hub_submit`) runs the identical `artifact_validate` checks locally and reports pass/fail in an accessible hardened dialog. Picking a Quillin's `manifest.json` validates the whole folder (the accessible alternative to a directory picker). The Quillin Hub website opens in the browser only on the explicit "Open the Quillin Hub" button — QUILL itself makes no network call anywhere in the flow, so the command needs no egress-audit entry.

**Roadmap linkage.** Public deployment of the Hub is #517 (O14); the signing/marketplace trust model that would let vetted third-party Quillins load off the SEC-8 experimental flag is #519 (O16). This section covers the submission/validation platform and the in-app surface; signing and deployment remain open acceptance criteria on those issues.

**Implementation map.** `quill/tools/artifact_validate.py` (detection + dispatch; tests in `tests/unit/tools/test_artifact_validate.py`), `quill/ui/quillin_hub_submit.py` (submission-check dialog), `quill/ui/main_frame_quillins.py` (menu item + command), `quillin-hub/` (Flask service: `app/artifacts/registry.py`, `app/forge/`, `app/api/`, `worker/sync_to_pages.py`, `smoke_test.py`).

### 5.84 Skill Quill Pack (.sqp) — multi-step AI workflows in plain text

A `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) file is a Markdown document with YAML front matter where level-1 headings define sequential AI steps. It extends `.pqp` prompt packs from single instructions to multi-step workflows with parameters, variable chaining, and conditional branching.

**Motivation.** Many real AI tasks are not single-shot prompts. Research then draft. Analyse then rewrite. Detect intent then branch. Encoding this logic in JSON means writing a DSL nobody can author without tooling. Writing it in Markdown means any user can open the file, read every step, and edit it — no schema browser, no visual designer. The skill is the document.

**Key design choices:**
- No streaming — each step sends a full prompt and receives a full response before the next step runs. This makes step outputs reliable as inputs to subsequent steps.
- Synchronous execution from the caller's perspective; threading is the UI layer's responsibility.
- Depth limit of 2 for nested skill calls to keep execution predictable.

**File format (`quill.skill/1`).**

```markdown
---
schema: quill.skill/1
name: Research and Draft
description: Extracts topic, gathers facts, drafts a paragraph.
author: QUILL Project
version: 1.0.0
parameters:
  - name: tone
    label: Tone
    type: choice
    choices: [formal, conversational, neutral]
    default: neutral
---

# Step 1: Extract topic

Identify the main topic in: {selection}

# Step 2: Research

List five facts about "{step1.output}".

# Step 3: Draft

Write a {parameters.tone} paragraph weaving in those facts.
Facts: {step2.output}

```output
format: text
label: Drafted paragraph
accept_into: selection
```
```

**Special blocks inside steps:**

| Block type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `` `input` `` | Appends literal data to the prompt text |
| `` `condition` `` | Branches execution: `if: "X" contains "Y" / then: step3 / else: step4` |
| `` `output` `` | On last step: `format` (text/list/json), `label`, `accept_into` (selection/clipboard/none) |
| `` `use-prompt` `` | Delegates to a named prompt from the Prompt Library |
| `` `use-skill` `` | Calls another skill (depth-bounded) |

**Variables.** `{selection}`, `{document}`, `{title}`, `{clipboard}`, `{stepN.output}`, `{parameters.name}`.

**Validation tool.** `python -m quill.tools.sqp_validator <path>` validates one file or a directory. Exit 0 clean, exit 1 errors, `--strict` also checks for missing metadata.

**Bundled skills.** The `ai-writing-skills` Quillin ships four sample skills: Accessible Rewrite, Research and Draft, Meeting Notes to Action Items, Argument Strengthener.

**Implementation map.**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quill/core/skill_pack.py` | `SkillPack` dataclass, `.sqp` parser, validator, synchronous runner |
| `quill/tools/sqp_validator.py` | CLI validator |
| `quill/quillins_bundled/ai-writing-skills/` | Four bundled `.sqp` skill files |
| `tests/unit/core/test_skill_pack.py` | 23 tests: parsing, validation, runner, branching, bundled files |

### 5.84a Unified AI Library and the four-pillar AI menu (2.0)

**Goal.** Replace the scattered AI submenu and its overlapping dialogs with one
confident, top-level `&AI` menu built on four pillars, so the user feels QUILL has
*one* AI that knows where they are.

**The four pillars.**

1. **Ask Quill** — the single, context-aware conversation. The legacy "Ask AI" and
   "Writing Assistant" chat dialogs are retired into it (`AskAIDialog` deleted;
   `open_ask_ai` / `tools.ask_ai` removed), so there is exactly one chat door.
2. **Do** — context-first actions: the Concierge's "What can I do here?"
   (`quill/ui/concierge_menu.py`), the Selection Action Ring ("Rewrite & Improve"),
   and Run Agent.
3. **AI Library** (`quill/ui/ai_library_dialog.py`) — Prompts, Skills, and Agents in
   one `wx.Notebook` with one verb set (Run, New, Edit, Enable/Disable, Import,
   Export) and a real **Promote** continuum. `prompt_to_skill_source` grows a Prompt
   into a Skill; `skill_to_agent_markdown` + `save_user_agent` grow a Skill into a
   first-class user Agent saved in `agent_catalog.user_agents_dir`, loaded alongside
   the bundled catalog by `load_full_catalog`. Prompt Studio and Agent Center are
   retired into this surface; the full agent linter is the Agents-tab **Validate**.
4. **AI Hub** — the single configuration front door: provider, key, model, engine
   switching (Engines tab), GitHub Copilot setup, and **Session Branches** (Sessions
   tab). The old "Engine & Sessions" submenu is removed.

**The menu shape.** The top-level `&AI` menu reads, in order: Set Up AI (the on-ramp,
§5.84c) · Ask Quill (+ by Voice) · Accessibility Tune-Up · the context "Do" entries
(hidden in Basic mode) · Proofread / Translate / Read Aloud / Transcribe / More
submenus · AI Library · AI Hub · Use Artificial Intelligence (and Show advanced AI
features). Item count dropped from ~36 scattered entries to a short, scannable list,
each a single high-value action or a clearly-labeled one-level-deep submenu.

**Confirmed product decisions.** (1) AI is a real top-level `&AI` menu unconditionally
— the former `future.ai_menu_top_level` flag is retired as a placement switch. (2)
"AI Library" is the name for the unified Prompt/Skill/Agent manager. (3) The
Prompt → Skill → Agent **Promote** continuum is in scope and shipped. (4) Accessibility
Tune-Up stays a first-class, top-of-menu item given the screen-reader audience.

**Invariants.** Every list item and dynamic menu entry has a meaningful accessible
name; all dialogs go through `_show_modal_dialog` + `apply_modal_ids`; running any
action announces start and result; nothing is more than one level deep; the Library
and continuum are wx-free at the core (`quill/core/ai/library.py`,
`quill/core/skill_store.py`). One custom-prompt store: `prompt_migration` consolidates
the legacy `assistant_prompts` into the canonical `PromptLibrary` at startup
(reversible, idempotent). Deprecated dialogs retired; the live `assistant_agents`
plan/profile helpers stay (they back a live agent-run path), and `assistant_prompts`
stays until the prompt migration is sunset.

---

### 5.84b The Listening Companion — Transcript Actions and the Action Builder (2.0)

**Goal.** Make transcription the *beginning* of an agentic writing experience, not
the end: turn audio into the document the user actually needs, with a gentle, guided,
adjustable path. Folds the agentic transcription magic of BITS Whisperer into QUILL's
unified AI framework.

**Transcript Actions** (`quill/core/ai/transcript_actions.py`, wx-free). Ten
built-in actions — Meeting Minutes, Action Items, Executive Summary, Interview Notes,
Study Notes, Q&A Extraction, Clean Up & Draft, Follow-Up Email, Key Quotes, and
Decisions Log — each a named, plain-language, *adjustable* instruction with a prompt
builder. `recommend_actions` orders them for the transcript in front of the user
(multi-speaker leads with Minutes / Action Items / Decisions / a follow-up email;
question-dense with Q&A / Interview / Key Quotes; single voice with Clean Up & Draft)
while keeping every action available. Reachable two ways: the post-transcription "What
would you like me to make of this?" chooser (`quill/ui/transcript_actions_ui.py`,
hooked into `_show_transcription_result`) and an `AI > Transcribe Audio > Transcript
Actions...` item that runs them on the current selection/document. Results open in a
new buffer; the original transcript is never overwritten. Generation uses the unified
`ProviderChatBackend`; the flow degrades gently when AI is off, and offers the AI
Setup Wizard (§5.84c) at that high-intent moment instead of a dead end.

**Guided Action Builder** (`quill/ui/action_builder_dialog.py`). A no-syntax,
form-based builder (name, start-from preset, plain-language instructions, optional
**reference attachment**, Save) reached from the AI Library Skills tab. It writes a
real Skill via `action_to_skill_source` + `SkillStore`, so a user-defined action
immediately gains Run / Edit / Enable / Export / Promote. A reference document (txt /
md directly, docx and friends via markitdown) is woven into the saved action so its
output matches the user's template, terminology, and house style.

**Automation.** A watch-folder transcribe profile can chain "transcribe → run a
Transcript Action → save the document" next to the audio
(`watch_transcribe._maybe_make_action_document`), Do-Not-Disturb-aware. AI off / no
provider / a failed action skips the document step with a clear note and always keeps
the transcript.

**Principles (non-negotiable for this audience).** Easy (one choice, one keystroke),
delightful, guided, principled (consent + preview + undo + private by default),
powerful (the full agentic stack underneath), adjustable by instruction and prompt,
and gentle for learners.

**Status: complete.** Shipped: Transcript Actions (post-transcription and anytime),
the guided Action Builder, reference attachments, watch-folder automation, and the AI
onboarding wizard with Basic mode and on-ramps (§5.84c). **Live + diarized streaming
actions were deliberately not built:** most of that value is already delivered by file
transcription plus watch-folder automation, and its one genuinely unique kernel — live
captioning — is a separate accessibility feature that would need real-time audio
capture infrastructure; if it is ever wanted it should be scoped on its own merits, not
bolted onto this companion.

---

### 5.84c AI onboarding — the Setup Wizard, on-ramps, and experience modes (2.0)

**Goal.** Make getting started with AI a gentle, magical, screen-reader-first
experience across the whole AI landscape — no jargon, no dead ends, finished in
seconds — and let newcomers grow into the full surface on their own timeline.

**AI Setup Wizard** (`quill/ui/ai_setup_wizard.py` over wx-free
`quill/core/ai/onboarding.py`). A one-step-at-a-time wizard (each step a single
announced focus context): a welcome, the one real choice — **on your device with
Ollama** (private, free), **use an AI account** (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter
/ Ollama Cloud, with a key pasted once and stored in the OS secure store, plus a
**Test connection** button), or **not right now** — a frictionless connect step, and a
tailored celebration. Neither path lets the user finish into a broken state: cloud
offers Test connection, and the on-device path **verifies a reachable local Ollama with
an installed model (`ollama_status`) before it commits** — if Ollama isn't running or
has no models, the step stays put with plain-language guidance (install from
ollama.com / `ollama pull ...`) rather than configuring something that won't work. The wx-free model owns the copy, the paths, the cloud-provider
options, the apply helpers (`apply_cloud_setup` / `apply_on_device_setup`), and the
persisted state, so it is fully unit-testable. Reachable as the first AI menu item
(**"Set Up AI... (start here)"** until done).

**On-ramps, not dead ends.** `maybe_offer_ai_setup` offers the wizard at the moment a
user first reaches for AI before it is configured — Ask Quill, the AI Library, and
Transcript Actions all route through it — and never nags someone who has already been
through setup. Because the AI Library's Run, Ask Quill, Transcript Actions, and agents
all share the one `ProviderChatBackend` (AI Hub) connection the wizard configures,
setting AI up once makes everything work.

**Experience modes.** `is_basic_mode()` / `save_experience_mode()` persist a Basic vs
Advanced choice (default **advanced**, so existing users never lose anything; the
wizard's "keep it simple" checkbox puts a newcomer into Basic). In Basic mode the AI
menu hides the power-user agentic entries ("What can I do here?", "Rewrite & Improve",
"Run Agent") so the surface stays calm; a **"Show advanced AI features"** toggle flips
it instantly. Everyday features (Ask Quill, Transcribe, Proofread, Translate, Read
Aloud, the AI Library) always stay.

---

### 5.84d Free / low-cost AI for everyone (writing-first)

**Goal.** Give every user a meaningful AI writing experience without a paid
flagship account, and without the project carrying unbounded per-user cost.
Flagship models are better, but the point is options for people who cannot afford
one and a sane default that meets people where they are. Agents work on the free
path too.

**Cost posture — bring-your-own free key + local, $0 to the project.** There is
no shared or hosted key. Each user either runs a local model (no key) or brings
their **own free key** (their own free daily quota), so there is no shared limit
and no cost or liability to the project. A subsidized/hosted proxy is explicitly
out of scope; the data layer is designed so a *capped* proxy could later be added
as an opt-in provider without reworking this.

**Two strongly-advised free paths, with good defaults** (`recommended_free_paths`
in `quill/core/ai/free_models.py`, surfaced on the wizard's connect step via
`FREE_PATH_GUIDANCE`):

1. **Best quality, free** — OpenRouter with the user's own free key. QUILL
   preselects a strong free writing model (`best_free_writing_model`, currently a
   Llama 3.3 70B free model). The model step's recommendation now leads with this
   free model rather than `openrouter/auto` (which can route to paid).
2. **Most private, free** — a fully on-device model (Ollama / bundled llama.cpp):
   no account, offline, nothing leaves the device; more modest quality.

The copy is honest: free hosted models can be slower and are rate-limited to the
user's own quota, and may log/train on prompts under their terms, so QUILL advises
keeping confidential writing on the on-device path.

**Get API key.** Every keyed provider in the wizard has a **Get API key** button
that opens that provider's signup page (`CloudProviderOption.signup_url`) in the
browser — no hunting for where to get a key. Disabled for on-device Ollama.

**Model dropdown (wizard + AI Hub).** The model is chosen from an editable
dropdown seeded with the provider's recommended ids (free-first for OpenRouter),
with a **List models** action to load everything the account/device exposes
(`onboarding.list_provider_models`); the AI Hub Provider tab uses the same pattern
(`_populate_hub_models` / `_on_hub_list_models`), replacing its old free-text
field, and refreshes suggestions when the provider changes.

**The free-model catalog** (`quill/core/ai/free_models.py`, pure/wx-free). Free
is **derived, not hardcoded**: a model is free when the provider reports zero
prompt+completion pricing, or (OpenRouter) its id ends in the documented `:free`
suffix — so classification survives OpenRouter rotating its free line-up. Models
carry a `cost_tier` (`free`/`low`/`flagship`), a coarse `writing_quality` rank,
and a `tool_use` capability flag. `fetch_classified_models` reuses the already
network-audited `ai_chat.list_models_raw` (no new egress site) to classify live
`/models` data by price. `resolve_model_for_task` advises the cheapest capable
model for a task verb (light verbs → free; heavy/agentic verbs → tool-capable).
The wizard's model description speaks a **Free** / **Local, free** cue
(`_cost_note`) so cost is audible where models are chosen.

**Agents degrade gracefully on small/free models.** Single-shot transform agents
(Rewrite, Summarize, Expand, Table of Contents — via `_run_agent_task` +
`build_agent_plan`) already run on any chat model. The multi-step Ask Quill
companion (`ConversationSession` tool loop) is capped to a near-single-shot step
budget on a model the catalog flags as unreliable at tool use
(`agent_editor_host._companion_loop_budget`), so a weak model **answers instead
of looping** on malformed tool calls — the turn's document context is already in
the prompt, so answering needs no tools. It is never a hard block, and the engine
label reads "simplified for a small model." Agent specs may declare
`needs_tool_use: true` (schema + `AgentSpec`) so the UI can note "works best with
a stronger model" (`free_models.stronger_model_hint`) while still offering them.

---

### 5.84e Agent harnesses — interchangeable agentic engines (shipped)

**Goal.** Let a user drive QUILL's agent with the AI agent they already pay for
— GitHub Copilot, OpenAI (ChatGPT), or Claude — without a second API key or
per-token cost, while keeping QUILL's edit-safety contract exactly as it is.

**The harness layer (`quill/core/ai/harness/`).** A *harness* is an
interchangeable engine that drives an agent session above the AI backend. QUILL
ships the **Native** harness (its own loop, always available) plus three
optional **SDK harness packs** in `quill/ai_packs/` — `copilot.py` (extra
`ai-copilot`, `github-copilot-sdk`), `claude.py` (extra `ai-claude`,
`claude-agent-sdk`), and `openai_agents.py` (extra `ai-openai`, `openai-agents`).
Every harness, native or SDK, drives the **same** `SafeEditorToolGateway` and
`PermissionBroker` and emits the **same** normalized `AgentEvent`s; a
`HarnessRegistry` tracks availability, and the Hub hides capabilities a harness
lacks rather than presenting a broken control.

**Safety law (non-negotiable).** The SDK packs run the vendor agent
**text-only** (`allowed_tools=[]`): the vendor's own file-editing and shell tools
are denied, and QUILL applies the produced text through its reviewed gateway —
permission broker, diff preview, one-step undo. The agent proposes; only QUILL
touches the document, and only with user approval. All of this is off by default
and disabled in Safe Mode.

**On-demand install (`quill/core/ai/sdk_install.py`).** The packs are never
bundled (large, fast-moving, and most users want exactly one). The first time a
user picks an engine, QUILL installs its extra with `pip` into the running
interpreter behind a consent + progress surface; the pack self-registers on the
next probe. An uninstalled pack reports `is_available() == (False, reason)` and
QUILL keeps working.

**Surfaces.** (1) **AI Hub → Engines tab** (`ai_hub_engines_panel.py`): list the
engines, **Set Up / Install...** (installs the pack, or opens the Copilot
onboarding dialog), and **Set as Active Engine**. (2) **AI Setup Wizard**: the
onboarding path *"Use an AI agent you already pay for"* finishes by opening the
Engines tab. (3) **GitHub Copilot sign-in** (`copilot_auth.py`): OAuth 2.0 device
flow (a short, speakable code) when a build provides `QUILL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`,
with a graceful fallback to the Copilot/GitHub CLI sign-in when it is not — so
Copilot works either way; the token lives in the OS secure store.

**Value.** Use the subscription you already hold ($0 extra), vendor-grade
orchestration inside QUILL's guardrails, and interchangeable engines that install
on demand so the base app stays lean.

---

### 5.85 Portable API key store

By default QUILL stores AI provider keys in the Windows Credential Manager, which ties them to the current Windows user account. Portable mode offers an alternative: a DPAPI-encrypted file (`keys.enc`) in the QUILL data directory, activated by the presence of a `data/` folder next to `quill.exe` in the portable bundle.

**Motivation.** Some users run QUILL from a self-contained folder on a network share or external drive. They want all QUILL data — settings, data files, and keys — to live in one directory without requiring Credential Manager access on each machine. A DPAPI-encrypted file achieves this: everything stays in the folder, and the file is protected by the Windows user-account key.

**Access priority chain (highest wins):**

1. Environment variable (`QUILL_OPENROUTER_KEY`, `QUILL_OPENAI_KEY`, `QUILL_OLLAMA_KEY`, `QUILL_ASSISTANT_KEY`) — for CI pipelines and developer overrides.
2. Portable file store (`keys.enc`) — used automatically when the running install is recognised as portable (a verified bundle anchor with `quill.exe` + `data/`).
3. Windows Credential Manager — default for standard installations.

**Activation.** Portable mode is a property of the bundle, not of the running environment. The portable build ships `quill.exe` at the bundle root and an empty `data/` folder next to it; that folder is the deliberate filesystem opt-in. No environment variable to set. If you want to convert an installed build into a portable one, copy the install folder to a USB drive and create an empty `data/` folder at its root; QUILL will switch to portable mode automatically. The previous `QUILL_PORTABLE=1` activation mechanism is no longer required and is ignored — detection is filesystem-driven. The `keys.enc` file is created automatically in `app_data_dir()` on first key save.

**Security properties.** The file is encrypted with Windows DPAPI using a QUILL-specific entropy token. It is decryptable only on the same Windows machine by the same user account that encrypted it. Moving `keys.enc` to a different machine or a different Windows account will fail to decrypt; the user must re-enter their keys.

**Implementation map.**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quill/platform/windows/credential_store.py` | Unified load/save/delete with env-var, portable file, and Credential Manager backends |
| `quill/platform/windows/dpapi.py` | DPAPI `protect_secret`/`unprotect_secret` (existing) |
| `quill/ui/ai_chat_dialog.py` | `_load_api_key`/`_save_api_key` updated to use credential_store |
| `quill/core/assistant_ai.py` | `_load/save/delete_api_key_from_credential_manager` updated to use credential_store |

---

### 5.86 Configurable data location (#615)

Where QUILL stores its data directory (`app_data_dir()` — settings, recovery, undo history, logs, and everything else under it) is a user choice, not a hardcoded path, satisfying the "Portable mode clarity" goal in §5.

**Storage modes.** `quill/core/storage_mode.py` persists one of three modes to `storage-mode.json`:

1. `appdata` (default) — `%APPDATA%\Quill`.
2. `portable` — `<app root>/data`, only available when the running install is verified portable.
3. `custom` — any user-chosen folder, stored alongside the mode as a `path` field.

**Portable detection without reopening L-9.** A prior security fix (commit `a4fec36`) gated `QUILL_PORTABLE_ROOT` behind `_DEV_BUILD` because trusting an attacker-controlled environment variable's *value* could redirect a user's data directory. That fix stands: this feature never trusts an env var's value directly, in any build. `storage_mode._resolve_app_root()` derives a candidate anchor from `QUILL_APP_ROOT` or by walking up from `sys.executable`, then only treats it as a real portable install when `quill.exe` and a sibling `data/` folder both exist at that anchor — filesystem evidence, not the env var's say-so. `run-quill.cmd` is accepted as back-compat evidence so a beta-1 portable bundle without a `data/` folder keeps working. `tests/unit/core/test_storage_mode.py::test_arbitrary_quill_app_root_alone_does_not_redirect_data` is a regression test mirroring the original L-9 threat model, and `test_quill_exe_alone_without_data_folder_is_not_portable` and `test_data_folder_alone_without_quill_exe_is_not_portable` lock in the new evidence rule.

**Where it's surfaced.**
- The first-run Setup Wizard's new Data Location page (`quill/ui/setup_wizard_pages.py::_DataLocationPage`) offers AppData, Portable (when available), or a custom folder via `wx.DirDialog`. On Finish this writes `storage-mode.json` directly — there is nothing to migrate yet on a fresh install.
- **Preferences → General** has the same three-way choice (`quill/ui/main_frame.py::_build_data_location_block`), for changing the location on an existing install.

**Restart-deferred migration.** A live move is unsafe: `CopyTray` caches its data directory at construction, `Settings` is loaded once at startup, and Windows has no atomic directory-move primitive that's safe against transient file locks. `quill/core/data_location.py` instead:
1. `request_data_location_change(mode, custom_path=None)` validates the target and writes a `pending-data-location.json` marker into the *current* data directory. Nothing moves yet; the current install keeps working normally until restart.
2. `apply_pending_data_location_migration()` runs first in `quill/__main__.py::main()`, before `ensure_app_directories()`. If a marker is present, it moves the old directory's contents to the new location (per-entry, via `core.storage.retry_on_transient_lock` for Windows' transient `EACCES`/`EAGAIN`/`EBUSY` locks), writes the new `storage-mode.json` at the destination, and leaves a one-time migration notice. On failure, the old location is left untouched and the notice explains what went wrong — data is never silently lost.
3. Preferences shows a "Restart Now" / "Later" prompt (`MainFrame._confirm_restart_for_data_location`) immediately after a change is requested, since the move only takes effect on the next launch.

**Implementation map.**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `quill/core/storage_mode.py` | Mode persistence; trusted-anchor + filesystem-evidence portable detection |
| `quill/core/data_location.py` | Pending-migration marker, restart-deferred move, migration notice |
| `quill/core/paths.py` | `app_data_dir()` resolves `appdata`/`portable`/`custom` via `storage_mode` |
| `quill/core/storage.py` | `retry_on_transient_lock` (shared by atomic JSON writes and directory moves) |
| `quill/ui/setup_wizard_pages.py` | `_DataLocationPage` (first-run choice) |
| `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | Preferences control, restart prompt, relaunch |

### 5.87 Timer Events

**Design goals.** Let a Quillin perform periodic, low-frequency background work — refreshing a status cell, polling a watched resource, housekeeping — without polling on the UI thread or observing keystrokes. A Quillin declares a `schedule` contribution: one or more named timers, each with an `interval_seconds` and a handler.

**Interval constraints.** `interval_seconds` is bounded to 60–86400 (one minute to one day). The lower bound keeps timers from becoming a high-frequency surface that could degrade screen-reader predictability or burn CPU; the upper bound keeps the value meaningful (anything longer is better modelled as a lifecycle event).

**Threading model.** Each tick runs its handler in a daemon thread via the out-of-process `ExtensionHost`, so a slow or faulty handler can never block the editor. The timer itself is a `wx.Timer` owned by the host frame; timers start when the Quillin loads, stop on disable/remove/reload, and never run in Safe Mode.

**Error handling.** A handler that raises is caught in the worker thread; the error is marshalled back to the UI thread and shown in the status bar. A timer error never crashes the editor and never stops the timer — the next tick still fires.

### 5.88 File-Type Contributions

**Design goals.** Let a Quillin react to opening a document of a declared file type — announce a braille page count for `.brf`, report CSV headers for `.csv`, timestamp a `.log` — without subscribing to every `document.opened` event and filtering by hand.

**Extension matching.** A `file_types` entry lists lowercase, dot-prefixed extensions (`.csv`, `.brf`). On open, the host looks up the document's suffix (lower-cased) in a per-extension index built at load time and fires every registered handler for that suffix. Because the handler runs real out-of-process code, `file_types` reuses the `document.events` capability and requires a `main` module.

**Dispatch model.** File-type handlers fire immediately after the general `document.opened` event, on a background thread, with a context of `{file_path, extension, filename}`. Dispatch is non-blocking; multiple Quillins may register for the same extension and all fire.

### 5.89 Snippet Gallery

**Design goals.** Give Quillins a way to ship a library of named, parameterized templates that users can browse and insert, without binding each to a command or hotkey. Gallery snippets run no code — pure text expansion — so they need no capability and no `main` module.

**Picker UX.** **Insert → Snippet Gallery...** opens a list of every gallery snippet from every enabled Quillin, grouped by Quillin, with a read-only preview of the selected snippet's body. Insert expands the snippet at the cursor (replacing any selection); Cancel closes the dialog.

**Parameter prompting.** A snippet body may contain `{param_name}` placeholders. Each declared param has a `name` (matching a placeholder), a `label`, and an optional `default`. On insert, QUILL prompts for each param in turn through the shared single-line prompt; cancelling any prompt cancels the whole insertion (nothing is inserted).

**Accessibility requirements.** The gallery is a hardened `wx.Dialog` routed through `_show_modal_dialog`/`apply_modal_ids` for the keyboard contract. The snippet list, preview field, and buttons all carry accessible names; selecting a snippet announces its name and source Quillin; Insert is the default button and Escape cancels. Param prompts are individually labelled and cancellable.

### 5.89a Classic-editor power features — Repeat, Restore Deleted Text, Describe Character

**Motivation.** Three keyboard-first conveniences from the lineage of the WordPerfect Editor that have no prior equivalent in QUILL. Each targets the same audience as the rest of the power-tool suite: writers who work entirely from the keyboard with a screen reader, and who value precise, repeatable, inspectable editing. All three ship **unbound** (no default shortcut), registered through the standard command registry so they appear in the Command Palette and Keymap Editor and recirculate into their conventional menus.

#### Repeat Next Command (`edit.repeat_command`, Edit menu)

A numeric repeat prefix for *any* command. The user invokes Repeat Next Command, enters a count in a native, focus-managed prompt, and the very next command dispatched through the command registry runs that many times — move down twenty lines, delete ten words, insert forty dashes, or replay a recorded macro N times — in one gesture.

- **Mechanism.** The count lives on `CommandRegistry` (wx-free): `arm_repeat(count)` clamps the value to `[1, MAX_REPEAT]` (`MAX_REPEAT = 1000`, so a typo can never spin the editor unbounded). `run(command_id)` consumes the pending count at the top of dispatch, resets it to 1, and loops the handler that many times; the run listener fires once per iteration so macro recording captures each step faithfully. The count persists only until the next eligible `run` — it does not leak across a session.
- **Self-protection.** The arming command registers itself as non-repeatable (`register_non_repeatable`), so re-arming while a count is pending never multiplies the prompt.
- **Scope.** Repeats commands dispatched through the registry (the keyboard path screen-reader users rely on). Re-entrant handlers that themselves call `run` see a cleared count and are not double-counted.

#### Restore Deleted Text (`edit.restore_deletion`, Edit menu)

A small kill-ring distinct from both Undo and the Copy Tray. QUILL's structured delete commands (`delete_to_line_start`/`_end`, `delete_to_document_start`/`_end`, `delete_paragraph`) record the removed span into a deletion ring; Restore Deleted Text presents the recent deletions in an accessible list and re-inserts the chosen one at the cursor.

- **Why it is distinct.** Undo reverts the last edit *in place*; the Copy Tray captures *copies*. The deletion ring captures *deletions* and lets the writer place recovered text *anywhere* — the modern form of the WordPerfect Editor "Cancel" buffer.
- **Mechanism.** `quill/core/deletion_ring.py` holds `DeletionRing` (newest-first, capped at three, collapses consecutive identical deletions) and `removed_span(before, after)`, which recovers the contiguous removed run by stripping the common prefix and suffix. `_apply_line_operation` records `removed_span` after every structured delete. The UI presents a `wx.SingleChoiceDialog` of speakable previews (`"Most recent (12 characters): ..."`); a single entry inserts immediately.
- **Read-only and bounds.** Honours the read-only guard; an empty ring announces "No deleted text to restore".

#### Describe Character at Cursor (`power.describe_character`, Tools → Advanced)

The screen-reader descendant of "Reveal Codes". An accessible dialog — rendered in the same read-only `ContextHelpDialog` the F1 help uses, so a screen reader reads the whole description in one pass — names the exact character under the caret.

- **What it reports.** Glyph (or a speakable stand-in for non-printing characters), Unicode name, code point in hexadecimal and decimal, general category in plain language, and a note for invisibles that bite writers: no-break space, narrow no-break space, zero-width space/joiner/non-joiner, BOM, smart quotes, en/em dash, soft hyphen, tab, and line endings. Non-ASCII characters are flagged.
- **Mechanism.** `quill/core/char_describe.py` exposes `describe_character(text, position) -> CharacterDescription` (a `summary` for the status line and a `detail` block for the dialog). Positions at or past end of text report "End of document" rather than raising. The special-character map is keyed by code point (built via `chr`) so invisibles are unambiguous in source.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/commands.py` (`arm_repeat`, `pending_repeat`, `register_non_repeatable`, repeat loop in `run`), `quill/core/deletion_ring.py`, `quill/core/char_describe.py`, `quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools.py` (`repeat_command`, `restore_deletion`, `describe_character`, `_deletion_preview`), `quill/ui/main_frame.py` (`_deletion_ring` init, non-repeatable registration, `removed_span` capture in `_apply_line_operation`), `quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools_menu.py` (manifest entries), `quill/core/feature_command_map.py`, `quill/core/help/topics.json`. Tests: `tests/unit/core/test_command_repeat.py`, `test_deletion_ring.py`, `test_char_describe.py`.

### 5.89b Reveal Codes (WordPerfect-style synchronized code inspector)

QUILL keeps formatting codes hidden so the editing buffer stays clean plain text (see the rich-text hidden-codes model). **Reveal Codes** is the on-demand companion: a second, synchronized view that makes every hidden formatting code and structural/invisible character explicit, navigable, and individually announced — the beloved WordPerfect feature, rebuilt screen-reader-first. The full design rationale is preserved in this PRD (this section is canonical; the former `docs/planning/reveal-codes-design.md` was retired into it on shipment).

**Activation and layout.** `view.reveal_codes_toggle` (**Alt+F3**, the WordPerfect chord; also **View → Reveal Codes**, a checkable item) shows/hides a pane docked **below the editor, above the status bar**. Hidden by default and zero-cost while hidden (the token stream is not built). The visible/view/verbosity state persists in settings.

**The F6 region cycle.** The pane is a first-class focus region. When shown it joins QUILL's existing rotation, so **F6** moves **Editor → Reveal Codes → Status Bar** (with Document Tabs / Preview when present) and **Shift+F6** cycles back — no new keybinding (`_current_focus_region_labels` / `_detect_active_region` / `_focus_region` in `main_frame.py` gained one entry each). `edit.find_all_matches` moved off Alt+F3 to `Ctrl+Shift+F3` to free the chord.

**Synchronized carets.** Both views share one logical position via the markup↔visible offset map. Moving in the pane drives the editor caret to the matching markup offset; moving the editor caret highlights the matching token in the pane (a throttled idle tick, off the typing hot path). The editor buffer is the markup, so the markup offset is the editor caret space directly.

**The token model (`quill/core/reveal_codes.py`, wx-free).** `build_code_stream(markup) -> list[CodeToken]` linearizes the document, built on `rtf_model.analyze_markdown` (per-character offset map + formatting) and `char_describe` (invisibles). Each `CodeToken` records `kind` (TEXT / FORMAT_ON / FORMAT_OFF / BLOCK / STRUCTURE / INVISIBLE), a display `label` and `spoken` phrase, both `markup_*` and `visible_*` offset ranges, an optional `pair_index` linking an ON code to its matching OFF, and `attrs`. Inline formatting (bold/italic/underline/strike/super/subscript/font/size/color/highlight/link) becomes paired ON/OFF codes; paragraph attributes (heading, bullet, named style, alignment, spacing, indent) become BLOCK codes at the line head; paragraph breaks become `[¶ Hard Return]`; tabs and notable invisibles (no-break/zero-width spaces, smart quotes, dashes) become their own tokens; everything else groups into TEXT runs. `token_at_markup_offset`, `pair_distance`, and `describe_token` support sync, pairing, and verbosity-aware announcements.

**Presentations and verbosity.** `reveal_codes_view` selects **Structured** (a read-only `wx.ListBox`, one labelled/announced item per token — the most accessible and the default) or **Flowed** (a read-only `wx.TextCtrl` rendering codes inline within the text, the classic visual/braille layout). `reveal_codes_verbosity` (quiet / balanced / detailed) gates how much each move announces. In-pane commands: `reveal.next_code` / `reveal.previous_code` (scan code-to-code) and `reveal.go_to_pair` (ON↔OFF).

**Accessibility.** Discrete, individually-named items (Structured) are the headline win over a visual-only Reveal Codes; entering/leaving the pane announces; codes are conveyed by bracketed text + label, never colour alone; navigation never chatters beyond the chosen verbosity. SAPI/braille users get the literal bracketed codes in Flowed mode.

**Scope note.** Read-only navigation, interrogation, and full bidirectional sync ship now (both presentations, verbosity, pairing). In-pane *editing* (delete a code to strip its effect; insert/replace codes) is the defined next step: it requires the formatting markers' exact character spans, which `analyze_markdown` abstracts away, so it is built on the marker-span work rather than shipped against the zero-width code boundaries to avoid corrupting markup.

**Implementation map.** `quill/core/reveal_codes.py` (model), `quill/ui/reveal_codes_pane.py` (the pane + sync controller), `quill/ui/main_frame_reveal_codes.py` (`RevealCodesMixin`: toggle, idle sync, in-pane command delegates), `quill/ui/main_frame.py` (pane creation in the layout; region-cycle entries; command registration), `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py` (View item + EVT_MENU/EVT_IDLE binding), `quill/core/settings.py` (`reveal_codes_visible` / `reveal_codes_view` / `reveal_codes_verbosity`), `quill/core/keymap.py` + `keymap_packs.py` (Alt+F3, friendly title). Tests: `tests/unit/core/test_reveal_codes.py`.

### 5.89c Story Studio — manuscript and long-form organization

**Goal.** Give a screen-reader user a first-class way to organize a book-length project — manuscript, characters, places, plot threads, research, and brainstorming — without a visual corkboard, while keeping every word in plain, portable text. Optional and additive; inert until opened.

**Model (`quill/core/story`, wx-free, strict-typed).** A *project* is a folder of plain-text files plus an advisory `project.quillstory.json` sidecar recording a title, the ordered manuscript spine (relative POSIX paths), and non-manuscript *elements* (`character`, `location`, `plot`, `research`, `brainstorm`). Loading is corrupt-tolerant in the spirit of the settings-migration delta store (a bad entry is dropped, the rest kept) and the sidecar never duplicates prose: with no sidecar the folder is still a project (its text files become the manuscript spine), so deleting it loses nothing. Persistence uses `write_json_atomic`.

**Binder.** `build_binder(project, read_text)` derives a tree — a Manuscript group whose file nodes carry heading-derived chapter/scene children (nested by level from the files' Markdown ATX headings), then element groups (Characters, Places, Plot threads, Research, Brainstorm). The tree is derived, never stored, so it cannot drift from the prose. File IO is injected as a `read_text` callable, keeping the core pure and unit-tested without a display.

**Front matter and fields.** Each element file may carry an optional leading `---` block of light structured fields, encoded by a small dependency-free codec (`key: value` scalars and `- item` lists; round-trips, preserves field order and unknown keys — deliberately no PyYAML dependency). Per-kind default field sets (`quill/core/story/fields.py`): character → role/goal/motivation/arc; location → significance; plot → status; research → source; plus a universal `tags` list. Empty fields are dropped on save; unknown keys and `type` are preserved.

**Compile.** `compile_manuscript(project, read_text)` concatenates the manuscript spine in order with each file's front matter stripped, producing plain text for the existing export pipeline (`quill/io/export.py`) — no new export engine.

**UI (`quill/ui`).** `Tools → Story Studio...` (command `story.open_studio`, also on the command palette; no default key, assignable in the keymap editor) picks a project folder and opens `StoryStudioDialog`, an accessible `wx.TreeCtrl` binder. Activating a file/heading/element opens it in the editor at the heading offset and closes the binder; activating a group expands/collapses it. **Edit details...** opens `StoryElementFormDialog`, a labelled field-per-row form that writes changes back to the element's front matter. **Compile manuscript...** opens the compiled text as a new untitled document tab for export. Both dialogs route through `_show_modal_dialog`/`apply_modal_ids` and are classified in the dialog inventory.

**Status.** Introduced in the 0.8.1 line. Deferred: richer field types in the details form (choices, dates), saved views and tag filters, and a one-step compile-and-export action.

### 5.89d Accessible Vault — linked notes, backlinks, and knowledge navigation

**Goal.** Deliver a linked-notes model — a folder of notes that link to each other, with searchable, bidirectional links — through spoken, keyboard-native surfaces rather than a visual graph. A backlinks *list* read aloud beats a backlinks *picture*. Optional and additive; the editor is unchanged when no vault is open. The Accessible Vault is **feature-complete for 0.9.0**: Phases 0–7 all ship with a wx-free, unit-tested core under `quill/core/vault` and accessible `Tools → Vault` surfaces. The small remaining polish (in-editor `[[`/`#` autocomplete popups, live-preview link/embed resolution, and a Vault Explorer tree) is tracked in [`roadmap.md`](../../planning/roadmap.md) §1.7.

**Model (`quill/core/vault`, wx-free, strict-typed).** A *vault* is a folder of Markdown/plain-text notes plus a `.quill/` cache (regenerable). `scan_vault` parses every note into `NoteInfo` — title (front matter `title`, else H1, else filename), aliases, tags (front-matter `tags:` + inline `#tag`), headings, block ids, and outgoing wikilinks — keeping file-relative offsets so a UI can open at a heading or block. The wikilink codec (`links.py`) parses `[[Note]]`, `[[Note|alias]]`, `[[Note#Heading]]`, `[[Note#^block]]`, and `![[embed]]`, leaving Markdown `[x](y)` and code spans/fences alone. `resolve.py` maps a wikilink to a note + anchor offset, reporting **unresolved** (→ create-on-follow) and **ambiguous** (→ a spoken chooser, never a guess). `index.py` builds forward + reverse adjacency; `backlinks()` quotes each linking line for context, `unlinked_mentions()` finds plain-text name occurrences not yet linked, and `neighborhood()` returns a note's outgoing links (with titles) and backlinks together for "traverse the web by ear." The higher phases add, each wx-free and unit-tested: `search.py` (title-ranked full-text search + a subsequence fuzzy quick switcher), `tags.py` (a nested-tag-aware index — `#area/sub` also answers to `#area` — with counts and `#` suggestions), `render.py` (`[[link]]`→HTML resolution for preview/export, plus `![[embed]]` expansion of a block, heading section, or whole note with cycle detection), `templates.py`/`dailynotes.py` ({{date}}/{{time}}/{{title}}/{{prompt}}/{{cursor}} substitution and daily-note path math), `site_export.py` (a static linked HTML site as `{path: html}`), `sync.py` (commit/pull/push over an injected subprocess runner with conflict detection), `publish.py` (a **gated** single-note publish payload), and `refactor.py` (offset-precise inbound-link edits for a rename). Story Studio (§5.89c) is a curated collection view over this vault and shares the front-matter/heading machinery.

**UI (`Tools → Vault`, all palette-reachable + keymap-assignable with no default keys; dialogs route through `_show_modal_dialog`/`apply_modal_ids` and are classified in the dialog inventory).**

- *Phases 0–2 — links & backlinks.* **Open Vault...** (`vault.open`) indexes a folder and remembers it (`Settings.vault_root`), announcing "Vault X: N notes, M links." **Follow Wikilink** (`vault.follow_link`) opens the note under the caret's `[[link]]` at its heading/block; a missing target offers to create the note, an ambiguous name opens an accessible chooser. **Show Backlinks** (`vault.backlinks`) lists the notes that link here, each read with its linking line (Enter opens the source at the link). **Note Neighborhood** (`vault.neighborhood`) lists outgoing links (→) and backlinks (←) together for traverse-by-ear, and **Unlinked Mentions** (`vault.unlinked_mentions`) lists plain-text occurrences of the note's name not yet linked (Enter opens the source at the mention). **Insert Link to Note...** (`vault.insert_link`) inserts `[[Title]]`. **Rename Note...** (`vault.rename`) renames the current note over `refactor.plan_note_rename` — after a confirm that counts the affected links, it rewrites every inbound `[[link]]`, renames the file, retitles a matching H1, and reopens the note. **Vault Explorer...** (`vault.explorer`) is a keyboard `wx.TreeCtrl` of every note by folder (`explorer.build_note_tree`); **Complete Link or Tag at Cursor** (`vault.complete`) completes an in-progress `[[note`/`#tag` from a spoken filtered list (`autocomplete.py`) — the accessible alternative to a floating popup.
- *Phase 3 — find.* **Go to Note** (`vault.quick_switch`) is a filter-as-you-type switcher (Down moves to the results, Enter opens the top/selected match) and **Search Vault** (`vault.search`) is vault-wide full-text search with Regex / Whole-word toggles, opening a result at its matching line. Both live in `VaultFilterDialog`, which speaks the running count as you type.
- *Phase 4 — tags.* **Show Tags** (`vault.tags`) is the spoken tag pane: filter tags with counts, then list a tag's notes (nesting rolls up).
- *Phase 5 — embeds.* **Speak Embed at Cursor** (`vault.speak_embed`) reads an `![[embed]]` target without changing text; **Resolve Embed Inline** (`vault.resolve_embed`) replaces it with its content as one undoable edit.
- *Phase 6 — notes.* **Insert Template...** (`vault.insert_template`) picks from the vault's `Templates/` folder, speaks each `{{prompt}}`, and lands the caret at `{{cursor}}`; **Open Today's Note** (`vault.today`) and **Previous/Next Daily Note** (`vault.prev_daily`/`vault.next_daily`) create-and-open along the daily pattern.
- *Phase 7 — share.* **Export Vault as Website...** (`vault.export_site`) builds a static, linked HTML site off-thread (links → relative anchors, embeds inlined) using QUILL's own Markdown renderer; **Sync Vault** (`vault.sync`) commits/pulls/pushes over the user's own git remote off-thread (Safe-Mode gated; conflicts listed, never pushed); **Publish Note** (`vault.publish_note`) is registered `feature_id=future.publishing` and stays **hidden** until publishing is unlocked. **Vault Settings...** (`vault.settings`) sets the Templates folder (`Settings.vault_templates_folder`, default `Templates`) and daily-note pattern (`Settings.vault_daily_pattern`, default `Journal/{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}.md`).

**Preview & freshness.** Previewing a note that lives in the open vault resolves it (`preview.resolve_for_preview`: `[[links]]` as titled inert anchors, `![[embeds]]` inlined) via a defensive passthrough that leaves every other document untouched. Saving an in-vault note re-parses just that note into the cached index (`apply_note_change`), so backlinks, search, tags, and the neighborhood stay fresh without reopening the vault.

**Non-goals.** No visual graph view or canvas (the link *relationships* are delivered as lists and navigation); no *hosted* sync/publish — Sync is the user's own git remote, and Publish is gated off. The Accessible Vault is **complete for 0.9.0** with no open work.

### 5.90 AI Writing Toolkit: architecture and feature matrix

This section documents the AI writing layer shipped in QUILL 0.6.0, covering provider abstraction, the connection model, per-feature design, and the data-disclosure posture.

#### 5.90.1 Provider abstraction

All AI features route through `quill/core/assistant_ai.py::generate_assistant_response(connection, api_key, prompt, *, max_tokens, timeout_seconds) -> (text | None, error | None)`. This function:

- Accepts an `AssistantConnectionSettings` dataclass (provider, host, model) and a bare API key string.
- Dispatches to the appropriate HTTP client (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic Messages API, Google Gemini, or Foundation Models on macOS).
- Returns a `(text, None)` tuple on success or `(None, error_string)` on failure.
- Never raises; all exceptions are caught and returned as the error string.
- Is imported at module level (not lazily) in every AI module so that test suites can monkeypatch it.

Supported providers:

| Provider ID | Host type | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | OpenAI cloud | API key (Credential Manager) |
| `claude` | Anthropic cloud | API key (Credential Manager) |
| `gemini` | Google cloud | API key (Credential Manager) |
| `openrouter` | OpenRouter cloud | API key (Credential Manager) |
| `ollama` | Local or self-hosted | URL only (no key) |
| `custom` | User-specified endpoint | Optional API key |

#### 5.90.2 Connection settings and AI Hub

Provider, host, and model are stored in `AssistantConnectionSettings` (serialized via `core/storage.py`). The API key is stored separately in the Windows Credential Manager via `platform/windows/credential_manager.py`, keyed per provider.

**AI Hub** (`quill/ui/ai_hub_dialog.py`) is the single entry point for all AI configuration. It is a five-tab `wx.Notebook` dialog:

1. **Provider** — provider choice, API key field, host override, model choice, Test Connection button.
2. **On-Device** — Ollama URL, recommended model list with size and capability notes.
3. **Audio Services** — Deepgram API key (with reveal toggle), max speakers (SpinCtrl, 2–20).
4. **Instructions** — per-task custom system prompt editor. See §5.90.7.
5. **Advanced** — consent summary, settings reset, safe mode documentation.

All writes in `_on_ok()` are atomic: API keys saved via `credential_manager.credential_save`, settings saved via `write_json_atomic`.

#### 5.90.3 Custom instructions

`quill/core/ai/custom_instructions.py` provides a per-task system-prompt layer.

**Data model:**

```
InstructionSet(task_id, title, default_prompt, user_prompt="", enabled=True)
  .active_prompt  -> user_prompt if non-empty, else default_prompt
  .is_customised() -> user_prompt.strip() != "" and user_prompt != default_prompt
  .reset_to_default() -> user_prompt = ""
```

**12 built-in tasks:** `chat`, `spell_check`, `grammar_check`, `rewrite`, `summarize`, `expand`, `toc`, `translate`, `thesaurus`, `document_qa`, `research`, `accessibility_agent`.

**Persistence:** Only user-modified fields (`task_id`, `user_prompt`, `enabled`) are written to `%APPDATA%\Quill\ai_custom_instructions.json`. Built-in defaults always live in code; a QUILL update that improves a default is automatically picked up unless the user has customised that task.

**Application:** `apply_instruction(task_id, base_prompt) -> str` prepends the active system prompt if the task is enabled. It never raises — any failure (missing file, corrupt JSON, unknown task) silently returns `base_prompt` unchanged. This is called at the top of every AI feature's prompt-building path.

#### 5.90.4 AI writing features

| Feature | Shortcut | Module | Dialog |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Thesaurus | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H | `core/ai/thesaurus.py` | `ui/ai_thesaurus_dialog.py` |

| AI Grammar Check | — | `core/ai/grammar_check.py` | `ui/ai_grammar_check_dialog.py` |
| Rewrite Selection | — | `core/ai/agent_session.py` | `ui/ai_agent_result_dialog.py` |
| Summarize Selection | — | `core/ai/agent_session.py` | `ui/ai_agent_result_dialog.py` |

| Read with AI Voice | — | `core/ai/cloud_tts.py` (dispatch), `core/ai/tts.py` (OpenAI), `core/ai/gemini_tts.py` (Gemini), `core/ai/elevenlabs_tts.py` (ElevenLabs SDK gateway, audio export only — roadmap §4.1), `core/ai/tts_chunk.py` (boundary-safe split) | inline in `main_frame.py` |
| Ask Quill chat | Alt+Q | `core/ai_chat.py` | `ui/ai_chat_dialog.py` |

#### 5.90.5 Agentic task architecture

Four commands (Rewrite, Summarize, Expand, Generate TOC) share a common agent session architecture in `quill/core/ai/agent_session.py`:

- **`AgentPlan`** — profile (from `assistant_agents.py`) + rendered prompt.
- **`AgentContext`** — plan + connection + api_key + `threading.Event` (stop_event) + optional `on_progress` callback.
- **`run_agent(ctx, *, refine=False) -> AgentResult`** — one or two AI calls; step outputs collected into `AgentResult.steps`; optional second refinement pass; refine errors are non-fatal (keeps first draft).
- **`AgentResult`** — `plan_id`, `steps: list[AgentStep]`, `final_output`, `cancelled`, `error`.

All agent runs are launched on daemon threads via `threading.Thread`; UI updates go through `wx.CallAfter`. The stop event is checked between steps and after each AI call.

**Result dialog** (`ui/ai_agent_result_dialog.py`): two-panel layout — step log (ListCtrl, read-only) and final output (TextCtrl, read-only). Buttons: Insert (cursor), Replace (selection), Copy, Re-Run, Close.

#### 5.90.6 AI Thesaurus

`quill/core/ai/thesaurus.py::get_synonyms(word, connection, api_key, context_sentence) -> list[ThesaurusEntry]`:

- Truncates word to 80 chars and context to 400 chars before including in the prompt.
- Calls `apply_instruction("thesaurus", prompt)` then `generate_assistant_response` with `max_tokens=512`, `timeout=30s`.
- Parses the JSON array response via `_parse_response` which strips markdown fences and extracts the first JSON array.
- Returns `list[ThesaurusEntry(synonym, note)]`.

The context sentence is extracted in `main_frame.py::open_ai_thesaurus()` by searching outward from the caret position to the nearest newlines, giving the model enough context to disambiguate polysemous words (e.g. "bank" financial vs. river).

#### 5.90.7 Custom Instructions UI

The Instructions tab in AI Hub presents:

- **Task list** (`wx.ListBox`): shows all 12 tasks; customised tasks show a `*` suffix.
- **Enable checkbox**: per-task toggle; when disabled, `apply_instruction` returns the base prompt unchanged.
- **User prompt editor** (`wx.TextCtrl`, multiline): editable field for the user's override.
- **Default display** (`wx.TextCtrl`, read-only): shows the built-in default for reference.
- **Reset to Default button**: clears `user_prompt`; the `*` marker disappears live.
- **Copy Default to Editor button**: copies the default into the editor as a starting point.

The `*` marker updates live as the user types (via `EVT_TEXT` on the editor). On OK, `save_instructions()` writes only the changed fields.

#### 5.90.8 Data disclosure posture

Every AI feature that transmits data outside the local machine is disclosed in the setup consent screen and in the user guide's AI Privacy Reference table. Summary:

| Data sent | Destination | Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Selected text or document text | Configured AI provider | Spell check, grammar check, rewrite, summarize, expand, TOC, thesaurus, translate, Document Q&A |
| Audio file (up to 25 MB chunks) | Deepgram or OpenAI Whisper | Transcription |
| Selected text or document (TTS, sentence-aware chunks) | OpenAI TTS API, Google Gemini TTS API, or ElevenLabs (SDK gateway, audio export only) per Settings > Read Aloud | Read with AI Voice, Export Document as Audio |
| Document text (up to 80k chars) | Configured AI provider | Document Q&A |
| Nothing (on-device) | Ollama local | All features when Ollama is the configured provider |

Custom instructions, provider settings, and API keys never leave the local machine.

#### 5.90.9 Safety and safe mode

All AI features are gated behind the `future.ai` feature flag. When `QUILL_SAFE_MODE=1` or `--safe-mode` is passed at startup, `generate_assistant_response` returns an error immediately without making any network calls. The Watch Folder `CloudTranscribeAction` also refuses to run in safe mode.

The AI-enabled gating tuple in `main_frame.py` disables every AI menu item when AI is not configured, so no network call can be triggered from the UI in an unconfigured state.

#### 5.90.10 Test coverage

| Module | Test file | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `core/ai/agent_session.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_agent_session.py` | 23 |
| `core/ai/thesaurus.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_ai_thesaurus.py` | 16 |
| `core/ai/custom_instructions.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_custom_instructions.py` | 22 |
| `core/ai/spell_check.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_spell_check.py` | 9 |
| `core/ai/grammar_check.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_grammar_check.py` | 19 |
| `core/ai/translation.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_translation.py` | 18 |
| `core/ai/transcription.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_transcription.py` | 16 |
| `core/ai/document_qa.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_document_qa.py` | 20 |
| `core/ai/tts.py` | `tests/unit/core/ai/test_tts.py` | 18 |

All tests follow the module-level import pattern so `generate_assistant_response` can be monkeypatched in tests without live provider credentials.

#### 5.90.11 Prompt caching

**Goal.** Reduce per-request token cost by sending the stable custom-instruction text as a cacheable system prefix rather than re-sending it inline with every call.

**Design.**

`custom_instructions.split_instruction(task_id, base_prompt) -> (str, str)` is the canonical split point. It returns the active system prompt and the user content as separate strings. Every AI module calls `split_instruction` instead of `apply_instruction` and passes the system_prompt through to `generate_assistant_response`.

`generate_assistant_response` accepts `system_prompt: str = ""` and threads it into `build_chat_body` and `build_chat_headers`. `apply_instruction` is preserved as a legacy convenience wrapper (it calls `split_instruction` internally and joins the parts).

**Provider behaviour.**

| Provider | Caching mechanism | Cost effect |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` block in the `system` array; `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header | ~10% of normal input rate on cache hit; 5-minute TTL |
| OpenAI / OpenRouter | `role=system` message; caching is automatic above 1024 tokens | ~50% of normal input rate on cache hit |
| Gemini | `systemInstruction` field | provider-defined |
| Ollama | `role=system` message in the chat messages array | model-server internal |

**Invariants.**
- When `system_prompt` is empty, the request body is identical to the pre-caching form (no extra fields, no extra headers). No regressions for callers that do not pass a system prompt.
- `apply_instruction` is backward compatible; existing call sites that have not yet migrated continue to work with the combined-string path.
- The Anthropic beta header is only added when the provider is `claude` AND `system_prompt` is non-empty, so the header never appears for other providers.

### 5.91 Startup-speech gating (verbosity shim)

QUILL's `quill.a11y.announce(...)` funnel (§9.5) is the single code path every spoken line passes through. As of 0.7.0, two startup announcements are gated through user-facing settings so the screen reader stays quiet on first run unless the user opts in:

1. The Document Guardian Quillin activation cue (`Document Guardian is now active.` / `is now inactive.`).
2. The screen-reader detection result (`Detected screen reader: <name>. Adaptive hints enabled.`).

#### 5.91.1 Settings and defaults

Two new settings live under the **Accessibility** group:

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verbosity_speech_enabled` | bool | `True` | Master gate for the spoken output channel. When off, every spoken announcement from built-in startup events and Quillin extensions is suppressed. The status bar still receives the same text. Acts as the shim for the 0.7.1 verbosity rebuild. |
| `announce_screen_reader_detected` | bool | `False` | When on, speaks the `Detected screen reader: <name>. Adaptive hints enabled.` line at startup, but only if `verbosity_speech_enabled` is also on. |

Document Guardian adds its own per-Quillin preference under **Preferences → Document Guardian → Lifecycle Announcements**:

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled_announcements` | bool | `False` | When on, speaks the activation / deactivation cue from `on_enabled` and `on_disabled`. The Quillin always writes its state to the status bar regardless. |

#### 5.91.2 Enforcement layers

Two layers enforce the gates so a regression in either one cannot re-introduce the spoken line:

1. **Per-Quillin check.** The Quillin reads its own setting before calling `api.announce`. `api.get_setting("enabled_announcements", False)` is the per-Quillin value, defaulting to off.
2. **Host dispatcher check.** `quill.core.quillins.host.ApiDispatcher._dispatch` checks `services.is_verbosity_speech_enabled()` before forwarding the `announce` method to `services.announce(...)`. The same gate exists in `quill.plugins.node_quillin_runner._dispatch_action` for the Node.js Quillin runtime. The new `HostServices.is_verbosity_speech_enabled` method is implemented by `_EditorHostServices` (the live-frame adapter) and faked in every test double.

The screen-reader detection result flows through `MainFrame._set_status_quiet` (status bar only) unless both `announce_screen_reader_detected` and `verbosity_speech_enabled` are on, in which case it flows through `MainFrame._set_status` (status bar + spoken). The status bar always receives the text, so sighted and low-vision users get the same information regardless of the speech state.

#### 5.91.3 Why two layers

The per-Quillin check exists because the user's preference for the lifecycle cue is **Quillin-local** — it travels with the extension, not with the global app setting. The host-dispatcher check exists because `verbosity_speech_enabled` is a global master gate that should silence every Quillin announcement, not just one. Together they keep the user in control at both levels.

#### 5.91.4 Verbosity system (shipped)

The full verbosity rebuild (roadmap §1.1; the deferred 2.0 polish backlog is consolidated in roadmap §6) replaces the single `announcement_verbosity` knob with a per-verb, channel-aware, user-customizable announcement system. It has **shipped for 1.0**: the pure-domain core lives in `quill/core/verbosity/` (wx-free, strict-typed, in `mypy` scope) and is live in the app. Beyond the foundation table below, the system now includes the **routing engine** (`engine.py`) reached through the single `VerbosityController.process()` choke-point that `main_frame` routes its announce path through; the **runtime modes** Quiet (`Ctrl+Shift+Q`) and Meeting (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) with status-bar badges, **Quiet Undo** (`Ctrl+Shift+Z`), and the status-query commands **Where am I?**, **What changed?**, and **Speak Status**; **mastery step-down**, **announcement history**, the **"Why did QUILL say that?"** explain trace, **Safe Mode/reset**, **QVP packs + library + preview lab**, **task-aware profiles**, and **import/export**; and the eleven `quill/ui/verbosity_*` UI surfaces (preferences, token editor, data-order editor, chord editor, library, history, preview lab, safe-mode reset, import/export, QVP install). **Announcement anti-spam** (`throttle.py`, §1.1 #408/#409): repetition collapse drops identical consecutive *speech* within a short window and an optional budget caps spoken announcements per rolling window — both applied at `process()`, affecting only the spoken channel (the visual status-bar floor is never throttled), configured by `verbosity_collapse_repeats` and `verbosity_max_announcements_per_window`. The remaining speculative "polish backlog" long-tail items are deferred to 2.0 (roadmap §5). The pure-domain foundation table:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `channels.py` | `Channel(Flag)` — SPEECH, BRAILLE, SOUND, VISUAL. `route_channels()` always folds in the VISUAL floor, which can never be disabled (the accessibility floor). |
| `tokens.py` | `TokenSpec` (name, type, description, derive, per-token filter allowlist) and the **twelve** engine filters (`upper`, `lower`, `title`, `ordinal`, `pad`, `pluralize`, `singular`, `duration_human`, `date_long`, `date_short`, `time`, `truncate`). No custom filters exist — the security boundary that keeps templates and QVP packs data-only. |
| `parser.py` | Strict template parser for `{name}`, `${filter:name}`, `${filter:arg:name}`; returns structured errors, never raises. `validate()` enforces the §13 contract (token allowlist, filter existence, type compatibility, per-token allowlist, argument rules) and produces the spoken summary. |
| `profiles.py` | Built-in `Beginner` / `Normal` / `Expert` / `Quiet` profiles + `CustomProfile` (JSON round-trip). `profile_for_announcement_verbosity()` / `active_profile()` give the legacy `announcement_verbosity` knob (`minimal`→Expert, `normal`→Normal, `verbose`→Beginner) its first real consumer. |
| `verbs.py` / `registry.py` | `VerbSpec` + `Severity` and the initial verb catalog (the 34 verbs enumerated in §15, across `nav.*`, `edit.*`, `doc.*`, `search.*`, `system.*`, and `_legacy`); `VerbRegistry` with duplicate-id protection and id-sorted `all()`. |
| `data_order.py` | Frozen, hashable `DataOrder` (verb id, ordered fields, separator) with move-up/down/reset/render. When both a custom template and a custom data order exist for a verb, the template wins. |
| `schema.py` | Draft-07 JSON schemas for verbosity settings, the custom-profile store, QVP packs (`additionalProperties: false`, required metadata), and profile import/export — the data contracts the later sub-PRs validate against. |

Tested by `tests/unit/core/test_verbosity_*.py` (102 cases; parser coverage 99%).

#### 5.91.5 Verbosity rebuild — engine and runtime modes (sub-PR 1.2)

Sub-PR 1.2 adds the routing layer on top of the foundation, still wx-free and in `mypy` scope. No user-facing surface yet (chords, status-bar badges, and dialogs land with the UI sub-PR), but the full decision layer exists and `VerbosityEngine.speak()` is reachable from the assistant-panel and AI-Hub announce paths through a no-op `speak_legacy_text()` passthrough.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `engine.py` | `VerbosityEngine.speak(verb_id, ctx, *, quiet, meeting, chord, trigger)` returns a `RenderedAnnouncement` (per-channel text, sound event, channels, profile, severity, template source, suppressed flag, and an `ExplanationTrace`). Template precedence: per-chord override → per-verb override → QVP → default. Channels are routed with the always-on visual floor; Quiet drops speech+sound, Meeting drops sound; the profile's `suppress_routine` hides routine confirmations (errors always speak); sound follows the profile's all / errors-only / off policy. |
| `quiet.py` | `QuietMode` (enter/exit/toggle + phrasing) and `VerbosityUndoStack` — the bounded §11 undo stack of reversible verbosity transitions. |
| `meeting.py` | `MeetingMode` controller (hard-mute sound, reduced speech, braille+visual remain). |
| `mastery.py` | `MasteryTracker` — per-verb success counter that signals a step-down offer exactly once at threshold (default 25), then resets so it never nags; per-verb and global disable. |
| `history.py` | `AnnouncementHistory` — bounded ring buffer of `HistoryEntry` records with filter-by verb/profile/severity/warnings; `redact_text` (on by default) keeps raw token values out of the record, storing only the user-facing rendered text. |
| `explain.py` | `ExplanationTrace` — the full "Why did QUILL say that?" account (verb, trigger, profile, channels, template source, per-channel output, suppression reason, mode/override/QVP flags) rendered to plain copyable text. |
| `safe_mode.py` | `VerbositySafeMode` (toggle + `QUILL_SAFE_MODE` / `QUILL_VERBOSITY_SAFE_MODE` env detection) and non-destructive `reset_verb` / `reset_chord` / `restore_builtin` helpers that return a new `CustomProfile`. |
| `feedback_tuning.py` | `FeedbackStore` — local Too Much / Too Little / Just Right tallies per verb with a gentle one-shot suggestion; declined verbs never re-suggest. No telemetry. |
| `task_profiles.py` | `TaskProfileSuggester` — opt-in, **off by default**, per-extension profile suggestions with accept/reject memory. |
| `import_export.py` | `.quill-verbosity-profile.json` import/export. Strictly data: structure is validated by hand and nothing from the file is executed (no `exec`/`eval`/`__import__` path), verified by test. |
| `storage.py` | Atomic `verbosity_custom.json` read/write via `write_json_atomic`; a corrupt file loads as empty defaults plus a load error for a nonblocking warning, never throwing the user out. |

Tested by 11 more `tests/unit/core/test_verbosity_*.py` modules (180 verbosity cases total; engine coverage 96%). The 16 `VerbositySettings` fields and the chord/badge/dialog surfaces are deferred to the call-site-migration and UI sub-PRs.

#### 5.91.6 Verbosity rebuild — QVP packs, library, and preview (sub-PR 1.3)

Sub-PR 1.3 adds the shareable-pack and preview core, still wx-free.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `quill/core/schemas/qvp.json` | The canonical `.qvp.json` schema (§20): nested `pack` metadata, a `templates` array, `kind` fixed to `quill-verbosity-pack`, `additionalProperties:false`. For humans/tools — validation is by hand (no jsonschema runtime dep). |
| `qvp.py` | Loads and validates packs by hand (structured errors, never executing pack content — no `exec`/`eval`/`__import__`, test-asserted) and runs the §21 install flow: JSON → schema → kind → `min_quill_version` gate → metadata → unique template ids → namespace-collision check → dependency check (missing deps warn) → validate each template against its target verb → install → announce. Returns `QVPInstallResult(accepted, rejected_templates, warnings, spoken_sequence, errors)`. |
| `library.py` | `TemplateLibrary` — a flat collection across built-in / user / QVP sources with save / rename / delete CRUD (read-only built-ins and QVP entries) and cross-verb `apply()`, which strips tokens the target verb doesn't track and reports them. |
| `preview.py` | The fourteen built-in Preview Lab scenarios and `preview_scenario` / `preview_all`, which render each through a `VerbosityEngine` and surface per-channel output plus profile, template source, channel mix, and suppressed content. |

Tested by `test_verbosity_qvp.py`, `test_verbosity_library.py`, `test_verbosity_preview.py`, and golden snapshots under `tests/golden/verbosity/` (220 verbosity cases total; qvp coverage 95%). The Library CRUD UI, the QVP install dialog, and the Preview Lab dialog are deferred to the UI sub-PR.

#### 5.91.7 Verbosity rebuild — the wxPython UI (sub-PR 1.4)

Sub-PR 1.4 adds the user-facing surfaces under `quill/ui/`, each A11Y-4 hardened (label-then-control via mnemonics, `SetName`/`SetHint`, `apply_modal_ids`, deterministic focus, no icon-only buttons, registered in the dialog inventory) and wired to the already-tested pure core. The dialogs are not yet menu/chord-reachable — that is sub-PR 1.5.

| Surface | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `verbosity_prefs.py` | The embeddable `wx.Panel`: profile picker, the four-channel mix (Visual checked + disabled — the always-on floor), validation-mode and mastery boxes, tool buttons (Preview Lab / History / Templates / Safe Mode / Import-Export), and a filterable verb table (master list + detail) whose Edit-announcement / Data-order buttons launch the editors. Initial focus is the filter. |
| `verbosity_token_editor.py` | Simple/Advanced **RadioBox** (not a notebook, §5 decision 6) over one template field; `Ctrl+T` validates and speaks the §13 summary, `Ctrl+Shift+P` previews (via `EVT_CHAR_HOOK`); Save is disabled with a tooltip while blocking errors exist; Insert-token and Speak-current-template. |
| `verbosity_data_order.py` | Move Up / Down / Reset / Preview over a verb's field order. |
| `verbosity_chord_editor.py` | Per-chord template overrides, validated against the chord's verb. |
| `verbosity_library.py` | Template CRUD (Save/Rename/Delete, read-only built-ins & QVP) + Install QVP. |
| `verbosity_qvp_install.py` | Browse → validate → install a `.qvp.json`, reading back the spoken sequence, accepted templates, rejected (with reasons), and dependency warnings; Install is disabled until a valid pack is selected. |
| `verbosity_history.py` | Review / replay / copy / explain recent announcements with a live filter; the explanation pane shows the full trace. |
| `verbosity_preview_lab.py` | The 14 scenarios with per-channel output (speech/braille/visual/sound), profile, template source, channel mix, and suppressed content. |
| `verbosity_safe_mode.py` | Scoped, non-destructive resets (disable custom / reset verb / reset chord / restore built-ins) with export-first. |
| `verbosity_import_export.py` | Data-only `.quill-verbosity-profile.json` import/export. |

The 3-tab About dialog already ships (About Quill, §"About"). Tested by `tests/unit/ui/test_verbosity_ui.py` (62 source-contract cases); the A11Y-4 banned-pattern, dialog-button-contract, escape-z-order, and GATE-11 gates pass, and `dialog_inventory.json` was regenerated with 12 new hardened surfaces.

#### 5.91.8 Verbosity rebuild — live wiring and polish (sub-PRs 1.5 and 1.6)

Sub-PR 1.5 makes the system live. `quill/core/verbosity/controller.py` (`VerbosityController`, wx-free) owns the engine, Quiet/Meeting controllers, the undo stack, announcement history, mastery, and Safe Mode. `MainFrame` gains `VerbosityCommandsMixin` (`quill/ui/main_frame_verbosity.py`) and registers eight `verbosity.*` commands (palette- and Keyboard-Manager-reachable). The announce choke-point (`MainFrame._announce`) routes through `VerbosityController.process` **only once the controller exists** (created on first verbosity use), so the default path is unchanged until then; once live, Quiet/Meeting suppress speech while the status-bar visual floor remains. Default chords avoid all conflicts (`edit.quote_lines` keeps `Ctrl+Shift+Q`): Quiet = QUILL key + Q, Meeting = QUILL key + Shift+Q, Verbosity Undo = `Ctrl+Shift+Z`; the rest are palette/Keyboard-Manager reachable. Eight scalar `verbosity_*` settings persist (mastery enabled/threshold, validation mode, history enabled/limit/clear-on-exit, task-profile suggestions, Safe Mode); collection-typed state stays in `verbosity_custom.json`. Live in-app behavior warrants a manual smoke run before release.

Sub-PR 1.6 (the original "100-item addendum") was **consolidated** into the deduplicated *Polish backlog*, now the authoritative status list in **roadmap §6** (the standalone `verbosity-system.md` archive was retired once verbosity shipped). Rather than 100 separate features: the duplicates and already-built items are folded into the foundation/engine/UI shipped in 1.1–1.5; the themed survivors (per-category verbosity via the verb registry, status-query commands, announcement flow control, safety announcements, friendly names, status-bar surfacing, scope profiles, sound learnability, coaching/discovery, braille polish) are tracked there; and the screen-reader-redundant items — **typing echo, command echo, speech rate/pause, punctuation/symbol profiles** — are recorded as **recommend do not build**, because QUILL speaks alongside the screen reader and must not duplicate or fight the settings (echo, rate, punctuation level) the screen reader already owns.

### 5.92 GLOW — Guided Layout and Output Workflow (shipped, experimental opt-in)

GLOW is QUILL's accessibility review and repair system: **guided confidence, not a
compliance dashboard**. It reviews what is in front of the user, explains each
finding in plain language, and applies only deterministic, reviewable fixes. The
`core.glow` feature flag shipped `locked_off` through 0.8.1 while the engine
deployment was finished; for 0.9.0 it ships as an **experimental opt-in**: the
catalog flag is unlocked, but every GLOW surface is additionally gated by the
Experimental tab (`experimental_acknowledged` + `glow_experimental_enabled`,
both default off) through `MainFrame._feature_enabled`, so GLOW is off by
default and user-flippable with no restart. The flag remains a normal
profile-controllable feature.

#### 5.92.1 Surfaces

All commands live under **Tools > GLOW** and in the command palette:

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| GLOW Audit Current Document | In-editor deterministic audit of the whole buffer (plain text, Markdown, HTML); report opens as a named scratch tab. |
| GLOW Audit Selection / Paragraph | The same audit scoped to the selection, or the paragraph/line at the caret. |
| GLOW Fix Current Document | Deterministic fixes into a *named preview tab* plus an immediate compare session against the original — accept with full knowledge, never a silent rewrite. |
| GLOW Fix Selection / Paragraph | Quick in-place fix of the scoped block; the replacement is selected afterward so it can be reviewed or undone in one step. |
| GLOW Audit File... | **(new with the unlock)** Structured-document audit — DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, PDF, EPUB, Markdown — through the shared engine on the background task pool; report tab carries score, grade, and findings. |
| GLOW Fix File... | **(new with the unlock)** Structured-document fix that writes a repaired copy beside the source (`name-accessible.ext`, numbered on collision). The original is **never** modified; consent names the output path before anything runs. |
| Check for GLOW Updates... (Help) | Opt-in engine update: signed manifest, per-wheel SHA-256, offline `--no-index` install, rollback to the vendored wheels on failure, restart to apply (GLOW-8). |

Handlers for the file-level commands live in the `GlowFileMixin`
(`quill/ui/main_frame_glow.py`); in-editor handlers remain in `main_frame.py`.

#### 5.92.2 Rules (in-editor, always available)

Markdown: heading-marker spacing (auto-fix), heading-level jumps, image alt text,
generic link text. HTML: missing `lang` (auto-fix), heading jumps, `img` alt
(auto-fix), generic link text, tables without header cells. Plain text: tab-indent
hazards. All formats: plain-language phrasing and dense-paragraph warnings, and
trailing-whitespace trim on fix. Implemented wx-free in `quill/core/glow.py`.

#### 5.92.3 The shared engine (structured documents)

Structured audit/fix flows through the `quill_glow_core` contract package
(`audit_by_extension` / `fix_by_extension` / `convert_to_markdown`), which bridges
to the `acb-large-print` backend when installed. Deployment contract (hardened
2026-07-02 after the MCP-era split broke it): QUILL's `glow` extra pins
**`quill-glow-core[glow]>=0.1.1` plus `acb-large-print>=8.0.0`** — 8.0.0 is the
first release that ships the split `acb_large_print_core` dispatch backend the
contract wheel bridges to; older backends satisfy the contract wheel's own loose
floor (>=3.0.0) and leave the engine silently unavailable. Vendored wheels live in
`vendor/wheels` for fully offline install. The seam (`quill/core/glow.py`)
degrades honestly: engine absent means an "engine not installed" report, never a
crash (GLOW-1), and severities map onto QUILL's error/warning/info levels.

#### 5.92.4 Privacy and consent

The default GLOW path is entirely on-device. The engine's optional networked
features — AI alt-text, Presidio PII redaction, WCAG language processing — are
structurally off: the seam forwards no feature-enabling kwargs unless the caller
passes a `GlowNetworkConsent` with a feature explicitly set after per-action
consent (GLOW-7). The engine update check is the only other network touchpoint,
runs only on explicit invocation, and is registered in the network-egress audit
(GATE-9).

#### 5.92.5 Accessibility contract

Reports are plain, heading-structured text in ordinary tabs (searchable, brailled,
speakable); every finding carries rule id, severity, location when known, and a
plain-language suggestion; fix flows announce counts and destinations; file fixes
are non-destructive by construction; background parses never block the UI thread.

### 5.93 Import / Convert Document — free-first conversion and OCR (shipped, all three tiers)

The supported document-rescue tool, now the **canonical spec** (the standalone
OCR planning PRD has been retired into this section; remaining depth items are
tracked in roadmap §5). The routing principle: **free first, local first, and
nothing is ever uploaded without explicit consent** — the paid cloud tier is
reached only when the free local tiers fall short, and only after a per-upload
consent dialog.

#### 5.93.1 The three tiers

| Tier | Engine | Handles | Cost / privacy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MarkItDown (`quill/io/markitdown_bridge.py`, ships with the `pages` extra) | Born-digital DOCX/DOC, PPTX/PPT, XLSX/XLS, HTML, EPUB, CSV, ODT/ODP/ODS, and PDFs with a text layer | Free, local, no upload |
| 2 | Local Tesseract OCR (`quill/io/tesseract_ocr.py`) | Images (PNG/JPG/TIFF/BMP/GIF/WebP) and image-based PDFs; CPU-only, no GPU | Free, local, no upload |
| 3 | Datalab Chandra cloud OCR (`quill/core/datalab_ocr.py`) | The accuracy escalation: complex tables, forms, handwriting, math, dense layouts, poor scans; returns Markdown/HTML/JSON | Paid (BYOK, per page on the user's Datalab account), cloud, **consent-gated per upload** |

The router (`quill/io/docconvert.py`, wx-free, strict-typed) implements the
free-first flow: born-digital types go to Tier 1; images go straight to
Tier 2; PDFs try Tier 1 and are measured by the **chars-per-page heuristic**
(`text_layer_looks_empty`, threshold 50 chars/page) — a PDF that comes back
looking scanned is flagged `offer_local_ocr`, never silently opened empty.
Tier 2 rasterizes PDF pages via `pypdfium2` (~150 dpi) and recognizes them one
at a time with cancel checks between pages, joining pages with the
screen-reader-searchable `<!-- Page N -->` delimiter. Tesseract's TSV output
supplies per-word confidence; a mean below 60 flags the outcome `looks_weak`
— the Tier 2 -> 3 escalation point. Tier 3 (`convert_with_cloud_ocr`) adapts
the Datalab result into the same `ConversionOutcome`, so every downstream
surface (open-as-tab, review, announcements) is tier-agnostic.

#### 5.93.2 Escalation prompts (never silent, cost/upload named exactly once)

Tier 1 -> 2 (stays free and local): *"QUILL could not find readable text in
<file>. It looks scanned or image-based. Run free on-device OCR (local
Tesseract)? This stays on your computer and does not upload anything."* —
Yes runs OCR, No opens the empty result anyway, Cancel imports nothing.

Tier 2 -> 3 (the only prompt that mentions money or upload; shown only when
the service is configured): *"On-device OCR finished, but the result looks
low-quality or the layout is complex. For higher accuracy you can convert it
with Datalab cloud OCR. This uploads the file to a cloud service and may cost
money."* — accepting leads to the §5.93.2a consent dialog; declining keeps
the local result. When Tier 2 is unavailable (engine not installed) and the
user declines the free install, the same offer applies — free-first order is
structural.

##### 5.93.2a Upload consent (every time, no exceptions)

Before **every** cloud upload, a consent dialog states: the document will be
sent to Datalab; continue only if allowed to upload it; consider
private/medical/legal/educational/financial/employment/confidential content;
Datalab deletes results ~1 hour after processing and QUILL retrieves promptly,
keeping the result only in the opened document. A **filename heuristic**
(`looks_sensitive`: tax/medical/patient/ssn/legal/IEP/... fragments — names
only, content is never inspected) prepends an extra CAUTION line. There is no
"don't ask again": consent is per-action by design.

#### 5.93.2b Cloud client contract (`quill/core/datalab_ocr.py`)

REST against the Datalab Convert API (`POST /api/v1/convert`, multipart, key
in `X-API-Key`; poll `request_check_url` with cancel checks until complete).
BYOK: the key lives in the credential vault
(`QUILL/services/datalab/api_key`) with a `DATALAB_API_KEY` env fallback —
never in settings files. HTTPS enforced; Safe-Mode blocked; injectable opener
keeps tests offline; GATE-9 entry `core/datalab_ocr.py::_request`. Errors map
to the PRD's friendly table (rejected key / billing issue / too large / rate
limited / unreachable / incomplete / empty / timeout), and logging carries
state transitions and page counts only — never content, output, keys, or
bodies. Non-secret knobs persist as settings: `datalab_enabled` (default
off), `datalab_endpoint` (HTTPS-validated), `datalab_mode`
(fast/balanced/accurate), `datalab_output` (markdown/html/json),
`datalab_paginate`.

#### 5.93.2c AI Hub Services tab

**AI Hub > Services** is the customer-facing service manager (opened directly
by **OCR Service Settings...**): a plain-language intro naming the free tiers
first, then the Datalab card with a live status line (Ready / Needs API key /
Not configured), enable checkbox, key field (saved to the vault), endpoint,
default mode/output, page delimiters, an always-on "confirm before upload"
statement, **Test Connection** (key-presence + endpoint sanity only — states
explicitly that no document is uploaded), **Copy Service Summary**
(secret-free, `API key value: Not included`), and six provider link buttons
(website, API keys, pricing, privacy/security, API docs, supported file
types), each announcing that it opens in the browser. `open_ai_hub` folds the
saved Datalab fields back into the live settings object so the next
conversion sees them without a restart.

#### 5.93.2d OCR Review Mode (v1: the spoken checklist)

**Review Last OCR Result...** opens a named tab over the most recent
conversion: source, producing tier/service, page count, mean confidence,
warnings, and every low-confidence line pre-formatted as
`Page N: [NN%] text` (populated by Tier 2 from per-word TSV confidence).
The reviewer walks exactly the flagged lines and jumps into the converted
document by searching the page marker — review by ear, not re-proofreading.
Cloud/Tier-1 results state honestly that no per-line confidence exists.
(The full §12 review workspace — outline tree, per-block accept/re-run,
table review — is tracked as future depth in roadmap §5.)

#### 5.93.2e Temporary files

**Delete OCR Temporary Files** clears leftovers under the app-data
`ocr_jobs` folder (crash residue) and reports what was removed; the local
tiers use per-run auto-cleaned temp directories, so normally there is
nothing to delete. Results live only in the opened (unsaved) document until
the user saves.

#### 5.93.3 Engine acquisition (verified downloadable component)

Tesseract is never bundled. `quill/core/tesseract_install.py` downloads the
**byte-identical official UB-Mannheim 5.4.0 installer** (Apache-2.0) from
QUILL's pinned `assets-v1` release, SHA-256-verified (SEC-6), HTTPS-enforced,
Safe-Mode-blocked, then **launches the installer visibly** for the user to
complete — NSIS has no admin-free extraction analogous to `msiexec /a`, and
QUILL never silently elevates. Discovery
(`quill.io.tesseract_ocr.discover_tesseract_executable`) then finds the engine
with no restart: settings override (`tesseract_path`) -> QUILL-managed folder
-> `PATH` -> the conventional `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR` location. The
download call site is registered in the network-egress audit (GATE-9). On
macOS the managed download is not offered; a Homebrew-installed `tesseract`
on PATH is picked up automatically.

#### 5.93.4 Surfaces

- **File > Import > Import / Convert Document (OCR)...** (leads the submenu)
  and the same command in **Tools > Reading & Dictation**; palette id
  `file.import_convert`.
- **Tools > Reading & Dictation > Install Local OCR Engine (Tesseract)...**
  (`tools.install_local_ocr`) — consent names the size and exactly what will
  happen before any download.
- **Tools > Reading & Dictation > OCR and Conversion Services...**
  (`tools.ocr_services`) — the customer-facing services overview: a friendly
  card per tier (what it does, best for, local-or-cloud, cost, limits, setup)
  plus the live engine install status, in plain language per the OCR PRD's
  Services-tab content requirements. A full AI Hub Services tab ships with the
  first cloud provider.

Handlers live in `quill/ui/main_frame_docconvert.py` (`DocConvertMixin`).
Settings: `ocr_language` (Tesseract three-letter code, default `eng`) and
`tesseract_path` (explicit override). Commands map to `core.ocr` (the install
and services surfaces) so OCR-less profiles stay clean.

### 5.94 Math in QUILL — equation input, rendering, structural exploration, and Word export (shipped)

**Goal.** Close the gap the bundled math-equations Quillin always had: an
equation could be typed in, but nothing rendered it, nothing let a
screen-reader user explore its structure, and Word never saw a real
equation object. Full plan of record: `docs/planning/math.md`.

**Canonical model (`quill/core/math/`, wx-free, unit-tested).**
`mathml.py` holds the canonical in-memory representation — MathML, the same
input MathCAT and every screen-reader math engine already expects — with
the original LaTeX source recoverable via a `semantics`/`annotation` pair
(the same interop convention MathJax's own `tex2mathml` uses), so no general
MathML-to-LaTeX parser is needed. `latex_bridge.py` is a `latex2mathml`-backed
LaTeX-to-MathML bridge (the optional `math` extra; the module degrades to a
clear `LatexBridgeUnavailable` rather than failing at import time when it is
absent). `navigator.py` is a lightweight structural navigator — not a
MathCAT-quality math-speech engine — that steps through an equation's parts
(numerator/denominator, base/exponent, a root's radicand) and produces a
plain-English linear reading with a small set of template rules; it is the
"basic algebra, useful today" alternative to real Nemeth/UEB math speech.

**Input (math-equations Quillin).** `Ctrl+Shift+E` / **Insert → Insert
Equation...** takes LaTeX or MathML and wraps LaTeX as `\(...\)` (inline) or
a single-line `$$...$$` (display) — both MathJax's own default-recognized
delimiters, chosen specifically so no rendering template needs a config
change and so a bare `$` in ordinary dollar-amount prose is never
mistaken for math (the earlier `$...$` convention was replaced for exactly
this reason). **Insert → Snippet Gallery...** carries ten static
`$$...$$` formulas (quadratic formula, Pythagorean theorem, slope-intercept
and point-slope forms, slope/distance/midpoint formulas, difference of
squares, circle area/circumference) contributed via the existing
`contributes.snippet_gallery` manifest mechanism — no new UI. 88 Math
AutoCorrect-style abbreviations (seeded from the DAISY-published Word list,
daisy.org/MSMathCodes) are contributed via the existing Insert Automation
abbreviation system; `\delta`/`\Delta` and similar case-differentiated pairs
depend on a fix in `quill/core/abbreviations.py` — `build_contributed_library`
was silently dropping the manifest's `case_sensitive` field.

**Structural exploration.** **Insert → Explore Equation Structure...**
(`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, F`) parses the selection (or a fresh prompt) via
`navigator.py` and drives a sequence of `ui.choices` calls — no new core UI,
entirely within the existing Quillin capability model. Each `ui.choices`
call is a `wx.SingleChoiceDialog` (standard listbox semantics: arrow keys
move the highlight, type-ahead jumps to a match, Enter/OK activates the
highlighted item); **Escape/Cancel at any depth ends the whole session
immediately**, identically to choosing **Done exploring** — it is not "go
up one level," which is the dedicated **Back up one level** choice.
Descending into a numbered child re-announces (`ctx.announce`, speech only)
the new node and reopens the list for its children (role labels: Numerator,
Denominator, Base, Exponent, ...); **Read this part aloud** speaks a full
reading of only the current node via `quill.core.math.speech.speak()`
(below) and reopens the same list at the same position.

**Real math speech (`quill/core/math/mathcat_engine.py`,
`quill/core/math/speech.py`).** **Read this part aloud** is the one part of
Explore Equation Structure that upgrades: `speech.speak(element)` tries the
real MathCAT engine first and falls back to `navigator.read_aloud()` (the
template renderer) on any failure or absence — never raises, always
returns a usable string. The structural walk itself (numerator/denominator/
base/exponent stepping, the ambient per-step labels) is intentionally left
on the lightweight template system even when MathCAT is installed: those
labels are meant to be short list items ("Fraction", "Numerator: Group"),
and MathCAT's fuller natural-language prose would make them unwieldy;
`navigator.py` stays MathCAT-free by design so the mandatory install-nothing
path never depends on it.

MathCAT itself has no pip-installable Python binding, but a maintained,
separate C-interface project (`daisy/MathCATForC`, MIT) publishes prebuilt
Windows DLLs, header, and Rules data as GitHub release assets — no Rust
toolchain or PyO3 wrapper needed at all. `mathcat_engine.py` binds that DLL
via plain `ctypes` against its C-string API (`SetMathML`, `GetSpokenText`,
`SetRulesDir`, ...). The API is process-global mutable state (`SetMathML`
sets "the" current equation for the whole process), so every call is
serialized behind a lock. **Memory safety note, found and fixed the hard
way**: declaring a string-returning function's `restype` as
`ctypes.c_char_p` makes ctypes copy the string into a new Python `bytes`
object and discard the original pointer — freeing "it" afterwards then
frees memory Rust's allocator never allocated (confirmed by hand:
`STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION`). Every string-returning function is declared
`c_void_p` instead; a dedicated `_read_and_free` helper casts that exact
address to read it, then frees that exact address.

Distribution follows the existing `quill.core.release_assets` pattern
(whisper.cpp, kokoro, vosk, the braille pack, libmpv, spell dictionaries):
a byte-identical re-publish, pinned by SHA-256, on QUILL's own `assets-v1`
release tag, fetched on demand (**Help → Download Optional Components... →
MathCAT math speech engine**, ~3 MB) with the same already-installed/consent
dialog pair and Safe Mode gate every other component in that list uses.
`quill.core.optional_components._mathcat_installed()` is the availability
check surfaced in that dialog.

Known open item: MathCAT's own speech phrasing has at least one rough edge
observed directly (an implicit-multiplication connector rendered oddly in
one tested equation) that needs a real screen-reader user's ears and
possibly a `SetPreference` tuning pass (verbosity, `ImpliedTimes` style)
before this is the polished default experience — tracked as a follow-up,
not blocking the current shipment. Real Nemeth/UEB math **braille** (the
crate also produces it) is not wired here; that is a further follow-up once
speech quality is validated.

**Rendering.** Browser Preview and HTML export already carried a MathJax
CDN `<script>` tag; the actual fix was recognizing that MathJax's default
`inlineMath` delimiter is `\(...\)`, not bare `$...$` (dollar signs are
opt-in specifically to avoid colliding with prose), so switching the
Quillin's own delimiters to MathJax's defaults made both surfaces render
correctly with **zero template changes**. Verified empirically (headless
browser screenshot), not assumed.

**Word export and round-trip (`quill/io/docx_math.py`).** The native
python-docx writer (`quill/io/docx_writer.py`) had no math model; math spans
in a run's text are now detected and each converted to a real
`<m:oMath>`/`<m:oMathPara>` fragment via a one-equation Pandoc round-trip
(write a tiny Markdown file containing just that equation, convert to docx,
extract the fragment, splice it into the run stream via
`docx.oxml.parse_xml`). Falls back to the literal delimited text — never
silently drops the equation — when Pandoc is unavailable or a specific
conversion fails. `omml_fragment_for_latex` is memoized (`functools.lru_cache`)
so a document repeating the same formula does not spawn a Pandoc subprocess
per occurrence. The docx *read* path (both the default MarkItDown engine and
the Pandoc engine) already round-tripped a native equation back to `\(...\)`
text correctly; regression tests lock that in.

**AI.** A read-only `math-tutor` agent (`default_scope: selection`,
`modify_selection: deny`) explains a selected equation in plain language
without solving anything or touching the document.

**Shipped after all: real MathCAT speech.** An earlier pass through this
section concluded MathCAT integration meant QUILL building its own
PyO3/Rust binding against the `libmathcat` crate and standing up a new
native-build CI pipeline (comparable to `table_uia`) — that conclusion was
wrong, corrected once `daisy/MathCATForC` (a separate, actively maintained,
MIT-licensed C-interface project publishing prebuilt Windows DLLs) was
found. See "Real math speech" above: the binding is a `ctypes` wrapper
against an already-compiled binary, not a new Rust toolchain. Real Nemeth/
UEB math **braille** (MathCAT also produces it) is not wired yet — a
follow-up once the speech path is validated by ear, not a native-build
blocker.

**Explicitly skipped.** DAISY MathML export: `quill/io/daisy.py` is a
DAISY 2.02 *text-only* writer (no OPF/NCX/EPUB3), and no DAISY 2.02 player
has real MathML rendering/speech support, so embedding raw `<math>` there
would be inert markup, not real accessibility.

**Tutorial:** [07-type-math-like-a-pro.md](../tutorials/07-type-math-like-a-pro.md)
teaches the whole surface end to end — gallery first, then typed input, the
structure explorer, Browser Preview, and the Word round trip.

## 6. Spell checking deep dive

### 6.1 The TinySpell question

TinySpell is a small, fast Windows spell-checker that watches the clipboard or current input field and alerts on misspellings. It is genuinely useful for many users. So the question is: should Quill integrate tightly with TinySpell, or build its own engine?

We have chosen to **build our own engine**, tightly integrated into Quill, for the following reasons:

1. **Screen-reader fidelity.** TinySpell speaks through its own UI surfaces and conventions. Quill needs total control over how misspellings are announced, navigated, and corrected so that NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator hear the same predictable patterns. A loose integration would create a second source of speech that competes with our own.
2. **Document context.** TinySpell works across applications and therefore cannot use document-level context (heading structure, surrounding paragraph, language metadata, per-document dictionary). Quill knows exactly what document the cursor is in and can do much better.
3. **Per-document and per-paragraph language detection.** Multi-language documents need language switches mid-stream. An external tool will not know.
4. **Suggestion ranking that learns.** TinySpell's suggestion order is fixed. Quill ranks suggestions using the user's own writing and the surrounding sentence, which is the single biggest quality-of-life upgrade in modern spell check.
5. **Offline guarantee.** Quill commits to spell check working with zero network. An external dependency complicates that guarantee.
6. **Distribution.** Bundling TinySpell would create a licence and update story we do not control.
7. **Keymap and palette parity.** Every Quill action is in the palette and reassignable. Spell-check commands must be too.

We will, however, ship a small **TinySpell interop plugin** for v1.1 for users who already rely on TinySpell elsewhere and want a unified personal dictionary. That plugin imports/exports the personal dictionary file and otherwise stays out of the way.

### 6.2 Engine architecture: "Quill Spell"

Quill Spell is a layered local engine:

- **Layer 1: Tokeniser.** Unicode-aware word splitter that understands code (CamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case), contractions, hyphenation, URLs, emoji, file paths, and Markdown/HTML syntax tokens. It hands the next layer a stream of `(word, span, context_kind)` tuples where `context_kind` is one of `prose`, `code`, `identifier`, `url`, `markup`, `path`.
- **Layer 2: Dictionary stack.** A priority-ordered stack of dictionaries: per-document, per-project (if applicable), user personal, language-base (Hunspell), plus optional jargon packs (medical, legal, technical, scientific). The first dictionary that accepts the word wins.
- **Layer 3: Hunspell backend.** Bundled via `cyhunspell`. Dictionaries shipped: en-US, en-GB, en-CA, en-AU, es-ES, es-MX, fr-FR, de-DE, pt-BR, pl-PL, ja-JP (with MeCab). Others available via a one-click downloader.
- **Layer 4: Suggestion engine.** Combines Hunspell's edit-distance suggestions with a character-level n-gram model and a small contextual reranker (a tiny on-device transformer; runs on CPU in <10 ms per call). Top 5 suggestions, ranked by combined score.
- **Layer 5: Learning loop.** When the user accepts a suggestion, the engine increments its frequency. When the user adds a word, it goes to the appropriate dictionary (with a prompt asking which). When the user repeatedly rejects a suggestion in favour of another, the reranker learns the preference. Learning is 100 percent local and resettable.
- **Layer 6: Context awareness.** The tokeniser tells the engine when it is inside a code fence, an inline code span, a URL, or a Markdown link target. Those regions are skipped by default. Settings let the user enable code spell checking with a programming-aware dictionary.

### 6.3 User experience

- **Status indicator.** The status bar shows the active dictionary stack as a short label, for example `en-GB + tech + personal`.
- **`F7` Spelling Review.** *(Implemented 0.7.0 Beta 2 — see §6.4 for the full specification.)* A modal guided dialog. Focus opens in a read-only multiline **Context** field with the misspelled word selected within its sentence. Tab order: Context → Change to → Suggestions → Change → Change All → Ignore Once → Ignore All → Add to Dictionary → Undo Last → Close. All actions available without a mouse. Announcements are configurable (Concise / Balanced / Detailed). Optional letter-by-letter spelling of the wrong word after a configurable pause. Scope detects selection vs. whole document. Case-preserving Change All. Session-scoped Ignore All. Position-aware undo.
- **`Ctrl+F7` / `Ctrl+Shift+F7` next/previous misspelling.** Jumps directly to the next or previous misspelling from the caret without opening the full review dialog.
- **Background pass.** A debounced background tokenise runs as the user types. Results live in a sidecar model. No visual squiggles. The screen reader is never interrupted by background work.
- **Per-document language.** A YAML-style sidecar (`<doc>.quill.yml`) can pin language and dictionaries. Detected automatically from a magic comment on the first line if present.
- **Magic touches.**
  - When you add a word, Quill says "Added <word> to your personal dictionary" or "Added <word> to this document's dictionary" so you always know where it went.
  - When you reject the same suggestion three times for the same misspelling, Quill quietly asks once whether you want to add the rejected word to your personal dictionary.
  - When pasting a large block of text, the spell pass is queued at a lower priority so the paste itself is instant.
  - When entering a code fence in Markdown, the engine switches automatically to identifier mode and stops complaining about variable names.

### 6.4 F7 Spelling Review — Full Specification

> **Status: Implemented in 0.7.0 Beta 2.** This section is the canonical
> specification for the shipped feature; the original standalone planning PRD was
> retired to git history once delivered.

---

#### 6.4.1 Executive Summary

QUILL provides a classic, guided spelling-review experience invoked with **F7**. The feature preserves what made the traditional Microsoft Word spelling dialog effective — one issue at a time, clear suggestions, predictable actions, and an obvious path through the document — while substantially improving that experience for screen-reader and keyboard users.

The defining feature is a focusable **multiline, read-only Context field** that contains the misspelled word in meaningful surrounding text. The current word is selected when the field receives focus so users can hear it in context, review it character by character, move by word or line, copy text, and understand punctuation and sentence structure without leaving the spelling-review dialog.

#### 6.4.2 Product Vision

Pressing F7 in QUILL should feel reassuring and familiar:

1. QUILL finds the next potentially misspelled word.
2. The Spelling Review dialog opens.
3. Focus lands in a read-only multiline Context field.
4. The problem word is selected inside its sentence or paragraph.
5. The screen reader announces the issue, progress, and context without excessive repetition.
6. The user can inspect the text with normal editing-navigation commands.
7. The user can Tab to the replacement field, suggestions, and actions.
8. Every action immediately confirms what happened and advances to the next issue.
9. At completion, QUILL reports a useful summary and returns focus exactly where the user expects.

#### 6.4.3 Goals

**Primary goals:**

- Provide a complete spelling review through F7.
- Present each misspelled word in meaningful, navigable context.
- Make the entire workflow usable without a mouse.
- Make the workflow excellent with NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, and other screen readers using standard Windows accessibility APIs.
- Use standard controls and predictable focus behavior wherever possible.
- Provide concise, useful speech for state changes without duplicating what the screen reader already announces.
- Support Ignore Once, Ignore All, Change, Change All, Add to Dictionary, Undo Last Action, and Close.
- Preserve document integrity, undo history, caret position, selection, viewport, formatting, and accessibility state.
- Keep local document text private by default.
- Scale to large documents without freezing QUILL.

**Secondary goals:**

- Support multiple dictionaries and document languages.
- Provide configurable context size and speech verbosity.
- Provide a reusable review framework that could later support grammar, terminology, style, and accessibility checks.

#### 6.4.4 Non-Goals for Initial Release

- Grammar, style, readability, or inclusive-language review in the same dialog.
- Sending document text to an online service by default.
- Require direct integration with a specific screen reader.
- Automatically rewrite text without explicit user action.
- An always-open proofing sidebar.

#### 6.4.5 Design Principles

- **Familiar, but better.** Retain the strengths of classic sequential spell checking while resolving focus uncertainty, insufficient context, repeated speech, ambiguous button behavior, and loss of position.
- **Context is a first-class control.** The Context field is a standard, focusable, multiline, read-only edit control — not a static label.
- **Standard controls before custom controls.** Use native wxPython controls with reliable name, role, state, value, selection, and keyboard behavior.
- **Speech should inform, not compete.** QUILL announces transitions and results. It does not speak what the screen reader will already announce on focus.
- **No keyboard traps.** Every control is reachable and escapable. Tab and Shift+Tab move predictably. Escape never leaves the user uncertain.
- **User control over every edit.** No spelling correction is applied until the user activates an explicit action.
- **Preserve the document experience.** When the dialog closes, the user returns to the document with caret, selection, and scroll position restored.

#### 6.4.6 Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Issue | A token QUILL's spelling provider considers unknown or misspelled |
| Current word | The word under review |
| Context | Surrounding document text shown in the read-only multiline field |
| Replacement | Text that will replace the current word when Change is activated |
| Suggestion | A spelling-provider recommendation |
| Review session | The complete F7 workflow from invocation until completion or cancellation |
| Review scope | Selection or full document, depending on caret/selection state at F7 |
| Session ignore | A word ignored until the current review session ends |
| User dictionary | A persistent, language-specific list of accepted words |

#### 6.4.7 Invocation and Review Scope

- **F7:** Start Spelling Review. Also available from **Tools > Spell Check...**
- **Scope rules:**
  1. If the editor has a nonempty selection, F7 checks the selection only.
  2. If there is no selection, F7 checks the entire document.
  3. If the document is empty, QUILL reports that and takes no action.
- The opening announcement states the scope: *"Spelling review. Checking selected text."* or *"Spelling review. Checking document."*

#### 6.4.8 Main Dialog Specification

**Dialog model:** Modal. Title format: **Spelling Review — Issue 3 of 18**

**Tab order:**
1. Context field
2. Change to field
3. Suggestions list
4. Change button
5. Change All button
6. Ignore Once button
7. Ignore All button
8. Add to Dictionary button
9. Undo Last button
10. Close button

**Issue label:** A bold static text label above Context showing *"Not in dictionary: word"*.

#### 6.4.9 Context Field

- Standard multiline `wx.TextCtrl` with read-only and multiline styles.
- Labeled **Context around word (Alt+W to reselect)**.
- Focusable; included in Tab order.
- Supports character, word, line navigation and Ctrl+C copy.
- Protected from modification, pasting, or deletion.
- On each new issue: populates, computes word offsets, selects the word, moves focus via `wx.CallAfter`.
- **Alt+W** at any time refocuses Context and reselects the current word.

**Context construction** (`quill/core/spelling/context_builder.py`):

- Splits on sentence boundaries using `re.split(r"(?<=[.!?])\s+", ...)`.
- Includes the sentence containing the issue plus adjacent sentences.
- Character ceiling: 900 characters (configurable via `spell_review_context_mode` setting).
- Falls back to a character window when sentence splitting finds no boundaries.
- Preserves original punctuation and Unicode characters.

#### 6.4.10 Change to Field

- Standard single-line `wx.TextCtrl` labeled **Change to** (`Chan&ge to:`).
- Pre-filled with the highest-ranked suggestion, or the original word if no suggestions.
- Full text selected on populate so typing immediately replaces it.
- Enter activates Change.

#### 6.4.11 Suggestions List

- Standard `wx.ListBox` labeled **Suggestions** (`&Suggestions:`).
- First suggestion selected by default.
- Changing selection updates the Change to field.
- Empty when no suggestions; list stays present, Change to pre-filled with original word; announcer says "No suggestions."

#### 6.4.12 Actions

**Change** — Replaces the current occurrence with the Change to field value. Confirms action, advances to the next issue.

**Change All** — Replaces all matching occurrences within scope for the session. Case-preserving: `teh→the`, `Teh→The`, `TEH→THE`. Reports replacement count. Entire operation is undoable.

**Ignore Once** — Skips this occurrence, advances.

**Ignore All** — Ignores all occurrences for the remainder of the session only. Does not persist.

**Add to Dictionary** — Adds the word to the personal dictionary via `core.spellcheck.add_word_to_scope("personal", ...)`. Reversible within the session via Undo Last.

**Undo Last** — Reverses the most recent spell-review action without closing the dialog. Supports: Change, Change All, Ignore Once, Ignore All, Add to Dictionary. Disabled when nothing has been done. Restores prior Context, Change to state, and counters.

**Close** — `Escape` or the Close button. Changes already applied remain in the document's normal undo history.

#### 6.4.13 Keyboard Map

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Move forward / backward through controls |
| Alt+W | Focus Context and reselect current word |
| Enter (in Change to) | Change |
| Escape | Close |
| Chan&ge mnemonic (Alt+G) | Change button |
| Change &All (Alt+A) | Change All button |
| &Ignore Once (Alt+I) | Ignore Once button |
| Ignore A&ll (Alt+L) | Ignore All button |
| Add to &Dictionary (Alt+D) | Add to Dictionary button |
| &Undo Last (Alt+U) | Undo Last button |
| &Close (Alt+C) | Close button |

#### 6.4.14 Screen-Reader Experience

**Announcement service** (`quill/core/spelling/announcements.py` — `AccessibilityAnnouncer`):

Three verbosity modes:

| Mode | What is announced |
|---|---|
| **Concise** | Progress numbers and action results only |
| **Balanced** *(default)* | Issue type, current word, progress, and results |
| **Detailed** | Balanced plus control hints and scope reminders |

**Optional spell-word feature:** After announcing the misspelling, QUILL can spell it letter by letter. Enabled by `spell_review_spell_word` setting. Delay before spelling starts is configurable via `spell_review_spell_word_pause_ms` (default 800 ms, range 100–3000). Implemented with `wx.CallLater`.

**Avoiding duplicate speech:** QUILL does not announce control names before moving focus. It announces only what the focused control will not convey: scope, progress, action results, completion summary, errors.

**Opening (balanced):** *"Spelling review. Issue 1 of 12. Not in dictionary: accomodate."*

**After Change:** *"Changed accomodate to accommodate. Issue 2 of 12."*

**After Ignore Once:** *"Ignored once. Issue 3 of 12."*

**Completion:** *"Spelling review complete. 9 changes, 2 ignored once, 1 word ignored for this session, and 1 word added to the dictionary."*

**Focus rules:**
- Focus lands in Context for every new issue.
- Focus never disappears after an action.
- Disabled controls do not receive focus.
- Closing the dialog returns focus to the originating editor.

#### 6.4.15 Session Data Model

Implemented in `quill/core/spelling/` package:

```
quill/core/spelling/
    __init__.py          — exports SpellingIssue, ReviewCounters, ReviewSession, build_context
    models.py            — ActionKind, SpellingIssue, ReviewCounters, ReviewAction
    context_builder.py   — build_context(text, word_start, word_end, max_chars) -> tuple
    session.py           — ReviewSession (owns text copy, rescan logic, undo stack)
    announcements.py     — AccessibilityAnnouncer

quill/ui/spelling_review_dialog.py   — SpellingReviewDialog (presentation only)
```

**ReviewSession** owns a `_text` copy, rescans after every action via `list_misspellings`, tracks ignored-once positions with offset adjustment (`_shift_ignored_positions`), and maintains an undo stack of `_UndoRecord` objects.

**`_UndoRecord`** stores: action kind, prior text, all_ranges (for Change All), prior ignore state, prior counters.

**Case matching** (`_case_match(original, replacement)`): checks `.isupper()` → uppercase, `.istitle()` → capitalize, else lowercase.

#### 6.4.16 Settings

Settings group added in `quill/core/settings_specs.py` and `quill/core/settings.py`:

| Setting key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spell_review_verbosity` | choice | `"balanced"` | Announcement verbosity: concise / balanced / detailed |
| `spell_review_spell_word` | bool | `True` | Spell the wrong word letter by letter after announcing it |
| `spell_review_spell_word_pause_ms` | int (100–3000) | `800` | Milliseconds before letter-spelling starts |
| `spell_review_wrap_to_beginning` | bool | `True` | After reaching end of document, wrap to beginning |
| `spell_review_context_mode` | choice | `"sentence"` | Context extraction mode: sentence / paragraph |

#### 6.4.17 Acceptance Criteria

The feature is considered complete when:

1. F7 starts Spelling Review from the active editable document.
2. A nonempty selection is checked without modifying text outside the selection.
3. The dialog uses standard accessible controls throughout.
4. Initial focus lands in the multiline read-only Context field.
5. The active word is selected in Context.
6. Users can navigate Context by character, word, and line and can copy text.
7. Users can reselect the active word with Alt+W.
8. Replacement and Suggestions are fully keyboard operable.
9. Change, Change All, Ignore Once, Ignore All, Add to Dictionary, Undo Last, and Close work correctly.
10. Every action results in a concise, understandable state update.
11. Focus never becomes lost or trapped.
12. Closing returns focus to the originating editor.
13. Changes participate correctly in QUILL's undo history.
14. Change All respects scope and capitalisation rules.
15. Missing dictionaries and provider failures produce accessible messages.
16. NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator can complete the workflow without mouse input.
17. The dialog works in high contrast and at 200% scaling without clipping essential controls.
18. Automated tests cover context offsets, session actions, scope boundaries, position-drift after replacements, and completion behavior.
19. User documentation explains F7, review scope, all actions, and keyboard commands.

#### 6.4.18 Future Enhancements

These remain out of scope for the initial release but can reuse the review session framework:

- Grammar and repeated-word detection
- Style and clarity review
- Terminology enforcement
- Custom organisational and domain dictionaries
- "Explain this suggestion" for advanced providers
- Resume an interrupted review session
- Review only comments, headings, or selected structural regions
- Plugin-contributed proofing providers
- Braille-optimised announcement mode
- A compact review mode for experienced users
- Optional modeless review pane after the modal workflow is mature and proven accessible

## 7. Command palette deep dive

The command palette is modelled directly on Visual Studio Code's, adapted for screen readers.

### 7.1 Opening and dismissing

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` opens the palette in command mode.
- `F1` does the same.
- Each prefix shortcut (below) opens the palette pre-seeded with that prefix.
- `Esc` closes without action.
- `Enter` runs the selected entry (and remembers it).
- `Tab` from the input moves into the list. `Shift+Tab` returns to the input.

### 7.2 Prefix modes

A single edit field, one list. The first character of the input may be a mode prefix:

| Prefix | Shortcut to open directly | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) or `>` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Run a command |
| `?` | `Ctrl+Shift+?` | Show help for all prefixes |
| `:` | `Ctrl+G` (when no page markers) | Go to line |
| `@` | `Ctrl+R` | Jump to bookmark in current document |
| `#` | `Ctrl+T` | Jump to bookmark across all open documents |
| `!` | `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Show issues (spell check, bookmark, format) |
| `<` | `Ctrl+E` | Open a recent file |
| `~` | `Ctrl+Shift+O` | Switch open document |
| `=` | (palette only) | Open a setting |

These prefixes are themselves reassignable (see [section 8](#8-keymap-and-keystroke-reassignment)).

### 7.3 Matching

- Fuzzy subsequence match across the visible label.
- Each match scored by: subsequence tightness, prefix bonus, word-boundary bonus, recency, frequency.
- Top 100 results displayed, lazily.
- Ties broken alphabetically.

### 7.4 Rows

Each row in command mode shows three regions, all announced as one string by the screen reader (with internal punctuation chosen to read well):

```text
<Command title> — <current keybinding or "unassigned"> — <source>
```

For example:

```text
Improve Reading Order with AI — unassigned — Quill
Spell Check Document — F7 — Quill
Find Next — F3 — Quill
Pandoc: Convert to DOCX — Ctrl+Alt+P — Plugin: Pandoc Bridge
```

### 7.5 Inline keybinding edit

While the palette is open and a command is highlighted:

- `Right Arrow` enters keybinding edit mode for that command.
- A small inline edit prompt says "Press the new shortcut, or Escape to cancel, or Delete to unassign."
- The next keystroke (chord or sequence) becomes the binding.
- Conflicts are detected immediately and announced (see [section 8.4](#84-conflict-handling)).
- `Enter` commits, `Esc` cancels.

### 7.6 Recently used and pinned

- The most recently run 10 commands always appear at the top when the palette opens fresh, before any typing.
- Users can pin commands with `Shift+Enter` from the palette. Pinned commands always appear above recents.

### 7.7 Help

- `?` plus Enter, or `Ctrl+Shift+?`, shows a "How to use the Command Palette" topic in the palette itself: a list of prefixes, their meanings, and their shortcuts, each line runnable with Enter to invoke an example.
- Where Am I (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) in the palette announces: current mode, number of matches, selected entry, current binding.

### 7.8 Accessibility specifics

- The palette is a non-modal top-level `wx.Frame` over the main window with focus capture. Underlying widgets are a `wx.SearchCtrl` and a `wx.ListBox`. Both are stock controls, so all screen readers get correct announcements without scripts.
- Each list update fires a single accessibility event with the count of results; we do not spam announcements as the user types.
- Live region is set on the help/result line below the list for status messages such as "Keybinding updated" and "Conflict with Find Next."

---

## 8. Keymap and keystroke reassignment

Every Quill action is identified by a stable command id (`quill.editor.save`, `quill.palette.open`, `quill.spell.checkDocument`, etc.) and may have zero, one, or many keybindings.

### 8.1 Where keystrokes live

Three layers, in priority order:

1. **User keymap** (`%APPDATA%\Quill\keymap.json`). User edits win.
2. **Profile keymap** (optional, shipped alternatives). For example, "Word-like", "Vim-friendly", "Emacs-friendly". The user picks one as the base.
3. **Default keymap** (built into Quill).

The effective keymap is the merge of these three, with user > profile > default.

### 8.2 Keyboard settings page

`Ctrl+,` then "Keyboard" (or palette `=keyboard`).

The page contains:

- A **profile selector**: System (defaults), Word-like, Vim-friendly, Emacs-friendly, Custom.
- A **search field** that filters the table below.
- A **bindings table** (`wx.ListCtrl` in report mode, fully accessible) with columns:
  - Command title
  - When (context: editor, palette, dialog, global)
  - Keybinding
  - Source (default, profile, user)
  - Conflicts (a short marker if any)
- **Buttons**: Add, Change, Remove, Reset to default, Reset all to profile, Import, Export.
- A **"Press a key" capture field** for visual users who want to find what a chord does today.

### 8.3 Editing a single binding

Three equivalent ways:

1. From the command palette: highlight a command and press `Right Arrow`.
2. From the Keyboard settings page: select the row and press `Change` (or `Enter`).
3. From the menu bar: every menu item has a context-menu entry "Change keybinding".

In all three, the same small "Press the new shortcut" capture dialog appears. It:

- Captures any chord or two-key sequence (VS Code style, e.g. `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).
- Announces the captured keystroke as it is built.
- Refuses to capture purely modifier keys.
- Refuses to capture keystrokes reserved by the OS or by the active screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, Narrator) and explains which one it conflicts with.

### 8.4 Conflict handling

When a keystroke is already used:

- The dialog announces the conflict: "Ctrl+G is currently used by Go To Line in editor context."
- Three choices, each on its own button: **Replace** (the old command becomes unbound and the new one is bound), **Add** (both commands have this binding; the active "when" context disambiguates), **Cancel**.
- "Add" is only offered when contexts are distinct. Same-context dual binding is not allowed for safety.

### 8.5 "When" contexts

Each command declares which contexts it is valid in:

- `editor` — focus is in the main editor.
- `palette` — focus is in the command palette.
- `dialog` — focus is in any Quill dialog.
- `global` — anywhere in the app.
- `format:md` — editor focus, current document is Markdown.
- `format:pdf` — editor focus, current document was extracted from PDF.
- `selection` — there is a non-empty selection.

Contexts can be combined with `&&` in advanced editing.

### 8.6 Profiles in detail

- **System**: clean, modern Windows conventions (default).
- **Word-like**: brings Quill close to Microsoft Word for users migrating from there.
- **Vim-friendly**: a modal layer overlaid via plugin, off by default in the profile selector but available to install.
- **Emacs-friendly**: chord-heavy bindings (`Ctrl+X Ctrl+S` etc.), again via the chord engine.

### 8.7 Storage format

`keymap.json` is plain JSON, human readable, version controlled friendly:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profile": "System",
  "bindings": [
    { "command": "quill.editor.save", "key": "Ctrl+S", "when": "editor" },
    { "command": "quill.palette.open", "key": "Ctrl+Shift+P", "when": "global" },
    { "command": "quill.spell.checkDocument", "key": "F7", "when": "editor" },
    { "command": "quill.editor.gotoLine", "key": "Ctrl+G", "when": "editor && !format:pdf" }
  ]
}
```

### 8.8 Import, export, sync

- Export the active keymap to a single JSON file.
- Import from a file (with a preview dialog showing every change).
- Sync via a user-chosen folder (OneDrive, Dropbox, Syncthing). Quill watches the file and reloads on change, announcing "Keymap reloaded from disk."

### 8.9 Safety net

- A "Reset all keybindings" button exists at the bottom of the Keyboard settings page.
- Recovery: if `keymap.json` is corrupt, Quill renames it to `keymap.broken-<timestamp>.json` and falls back to defaults, announcing what happened.

### 8.10 QUILL key chord dispatch

The QUILL key (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave` by default) operates as a two-layer prefix system managed by `QuillKeyMixin` in `quill/ui/main_frame_quill_key.py`.

**Layer 1 — Prefix armed.** The first press arms a short-lived prefix state (`_quill_key_prefix_pending`). The following keys are handled as hardcoded mode gates and are not reassignable:

- `N` — enter Quick Nav (browse) mode
- `G` — open Go to Anything
- QUILL key again — enter sticky browse mode
- `A` (with selection active) — open selection actions surface
- `?` — show the prefix cheat sheet
- `Esc` — cancel without action

**Layer 2 — Chord command dispatch.** Any key pressed while the prefix is armed that is not a mode gate is dispatched via a data-driven lookup: `_chord_command_for_event` scans the live keymap for entries whose binding matches `<prefix>, <second-key>` and runs the matching command via `_run_command`. This means every chord command (read aloud, snippets, headings, copy tray, etc.) is fully reassignable in the Keymap Editor without any code change.

**Key detection.** The QUILL prefix key is recognized by three independent strategies so it works on any keyboard layout and Windows driver:
1. wxPython key code or Unicode key equals `ord("`")` or `ord("~")`
2. Windows virtual-key `VK_OEM_3` (0xC0) via `GetRawKeyCode()`
3. Physical scan code `0x29` (key below Esc / above Tab on PC keyboards) via bits 16–23 of `GetRawKeyFlags()`

**Keymap Editor validation.** Chord bindings (containing `, `) are validated separately from simple bindings: the prefix part must be a known modifier+key combination and the second-key part must be a parseable single key or modifier+key.

### 8.11 The Ctrl+Alt+ policy (revised 0.7.0)

Quill's long-standing policy was to forbid `Ctrl+Alt+` bindings outright because NVDA, JAWS, and Windows Speech Recognition intercept most of those chords app-globally.  The 0.7.0 release (EdSharp port) revises the policy to permit a `Ctrl+Alt+` binding when one of two conditions holds:

1. The command id is in the `_CTRL_ALT_DOCUMENTED` allowlist in `quill/tools/menu_lint.py`.  Each allowlist entry is paired with a screen-reader-binding justification in `docs/keybinding-standard.md`.  The historical `view.send_to_tray` and `view.toggle_tab_control` entries predate the relaxation; the new heading entries (1..6) are documented because they override NVDA's switch-to-synth-N.
2. The binding line in `keymap.py` ends with the inline comment `# §edsharp-ok — <justification>`.  The per-binding escape hatch lets future one-off bindings enter the keymap without a code change in `menu_lint.py`.

The rename from `_CTRL_ALT_ALLOWED` to `_CTRL_ALT_DOCUMENTED` makes the narrower scope explicit: the allowlist is "documented exceptions," not a free pass.  The gate continues to reject every other `Ctrl+Alt+` binding, and the regression test in `tests/unit/tools/test_menu_lint.py` (`test_ctrl_alt_uncommented_still_fails`) pins the contract.

The full audit lives in the new `docs/keybinding-standard.md` document.  The new EdSharp-port chord pairs (heading 1..6, list 7/8, section-move Alt+Shift+Up/Down) are all documented there with their justification comments and the screen-reader bindings they override.

### 8.12 The list-toggle chord pair (revised 0.7.0)

`Ctrl+Alt+7` and `Ctrl+Alt+8` are the EdSharp-port toggle variants of the existing `format.insert_bullet_list` / `format.insert_numbered_list` commands.  Each chord inspects the caret: if it is on a line that is already a list item, the markers are stripped and the line returns to plain text; otherwise a new list is inserted.  This decision is encoded in the pure helper `is_caret_inside_list` so the toggle behaviour can be tested without spinning up a `MainFrame`.  Plain-text documents announce the chord is unavailable; the action is skipped.

Numbered-list insertion is governed by a new `list_auto_fill_numbers` setting (`SettingsGroup` = "editing", default off) and a per-document five-minute arming flag.  The three OR together in `should_auto_fill_numbers()`:

1. The active document surface is markdown (the default-experience rule — a user who explicitly authored a Markdown file wants filled markers).
2. The `list_auto_fill_numbers` setting is on.
3. The user just toggled a numbered list on the active document — the arming flag is set to `time.monotonic() + 300` the first time the chord runs in the document and cleared on document close.

Outside of the three conditions, today's behaviour of one marker on the first item is preserved, so the change is strictly opt-in.  `Ctrl+Alt+9` for link insertion is intentionally not added because `Ctrl+K` already covers that command.

### 8.13 The Section status bar cell (revised 0.7.0)

A new `Section` cell appears in the status bar and reads `Section: Heading N (ordinal of total)` whenever the caret is on a heading in a Markdown or HTML document.  The cell is hidden by default so it does not push other useful cells out of the bar for writers who do not work at heading-level granularity; opt in via Preferences -> Status Bar and place the cell where it helps.

The cell dispatches on `infer_markup_kind(document.path)`.  Plain-text documents and carets on a non-heading line return an empty string.  The cell inherits the same `try / except RuntimeError` dead-widget guard as the other live-editor cells (line_column, word_count, selection) so a queued caret event after Ctrl+F4 cannot crash the status-bar refresh when the underlying C++ TextCtrl has been deleted.

The HTML path reuses the existing fence-aware `parse_heading_blocks` and `current_section_at` from `quill/core/markdown_sections.py`; both already handle `<hN>...</hN>` headings in the same way they handle `#`-prefixed markdown headings.

### 8.14 QUILL Key branding and menu label clarity (0.7.0)

Two changes ship together so the QUILL key is recognizable on first encounter and so every menu item shows its keybinding.

**Branding the chord.** The QUILL key chord is presented to the user as `QUILL Key + <key>` everywhere the editor exposes it: menus, the About > Keyboard Reference page, the QUILL Key Help dialog, the cheat sheet, and the status-bar / announce messages that fire while a chord prefix is pending. The stored binding (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave` in `DEFAULT_KEYMAP`, `keymap.json`, the `quill_key_binding` setting, the `legacy_rebindings` comparison table, and any saved `keymap/profile_*.json`) is unchanged — only the display layer rewrites the prefix. `quill.core.keymap_format.format_binding_for_display` is the single source of truth; `quill.branding.QUILL_KEY_LABEL = "QUILL Key"` is the single constant. Test coverage: 18 cases in `tests/unit/core/test_keymap_format.py`. A second helper, `format_quill_key_chord(prefix, second_key)`, composes a chord without inspecting a stored binding string so power-user status bar code can mention a chord without one in hand.

**Binding/label gap detection.** `quill.tools._check_binding_label_consistency` is the 4th `menu_lint` invariant. The check walks the AST of `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py` and flags three regression classes:

1. `_menu_label("", "command.with.binding")` — empty title literal routed through the builder for a command that has a keybinding. This is the regression that motivated the gate: a blank title + a bound command produced a menu slot with no readable name.
2. `<name>\t<binding>` literal drift — hand-written labels (the wx stock items and the editor's own `Close &Other Documents\tCtrl+Shift+F4`, `Help on This &Control\tF1`, `&What Can I Do Here?\tShift+F1`, `Open User &Guide\tCtrl+F1`) whose binding portion disagrees with the `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` entry or the wx stock binding.
3. Trailing-tab labels — labels that end with `\t` and no binding portion. The user would see a menu name with a trailing tab and no accelerator.

The runtime gap-check in `MainFrame._menu_label` (a one-shot `logger.warning` per affected item at first menu build) is the safety net for user-customization drift — a user who renames a label through the Customize dialog still gets a custom label; only the silent "blank menu slot" case is reported.

The check is wired into `python -m quill.tools.menu_lint` and exposed via 12 new test cases in `tests/unit/tools/test_binding_label_consistency.py`. The gate is part of CI; a regression anywhere in the binding/label chain now fails the build.

**Single source of truth for product name.** `tools/generate_build_info.py`, `scripts/generate_update_feed.py`, and `scripts/build_windows_distribution.py` import `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` and `APP_ORGANIZATION` from `quill.branding` so a rebrand touches one file. The TOML path still wins when `build/version.toml` provides a value (the installer and feed can be re-branded per release); the constant is the safety net for older checkouts and dev builds.

### 8.15 The Page status bar indicator (0.9.0 Beta 2, #872)

Every document shows a `Page` status bar cell, on by default (unlike most cells, which are opt-in), positioned right after the line/column position cell rather than first. For PDFs, it reports an exact page count and current page, derived from page boundaries preserved as form-feed characters at import (`quill/io/pdf.py`), reusing `quill/core/navigation.py`'s previously-dormant `page_starts()`/`page_start_for_number()`. For every other format (plain text, Markdown, DOCX), it reports an **estimate** derived from word count (`page_estimate_words_per_page`, default 300, clamped 150-600, Preferences > Navigation and QUILL Key) — this is explicitly not an exact science, and the cell's text always says so: `"Page ~N of ~M (estimated)"`. The tilde and the word "estimated" always appear together, never one without the other, so an estimate is never mistaken for a fact.

BRF/braille documents keep their own richer page system (the `"braille"` status cell); the generic `"page"` cell is suppressed whenever that one is active, so the two never compete for the same space.

Go To Page (`Ctrl+Shift+G`, also reachable by activating the Page cell) is track-aware the same way: an exact jump for form-feed-bearing documents via the existing `page_start_for_number`, an estimated jump (word-count-derived, via `estimate_page_start_for_number`) otherwise, with the prompt text stating which kind of jump is about to happen.

DOCX real page breaks are a known gap, not an oversight: DOCX import goes through Pandoc/MarkItDown text conversion (`quill/io/structured.py:_read_docx`), which does not preserve page-break positions, so DOCX stays on the estimate track pending a follow-up.

### 8.16 Speech Hub: Offline/Online split and Set as Default (0.9.0 Beta 2, #847)

**The Speech Settings dialog splits into four tabs instead of two** (`quill/ui/speech_hub_dialog.py`):
**Speech (Offline)**, **Speech (Online)**, **Dictation (Offline)**, **Dictation (Online)** —
`TAB_SPEECH_OFFLINE`/`TAB_SPEECH_ONLINE`/`TAB_DICTATION_OFFLINE`/`TAB_DICTATION_ONLINE`. Before
this, one flat "Dictation" tab mixed local engines (whisper.cpp, Faster Whisper, Vosk — install
once, no ongoing cost) with any registered cloud provider (a Quillin-based transcription
service — an API key, a per-use network cost) in a single radio list
(`build_engine_descriptors`); a "Read Aloud" tab did the same for SAPI5/DECtalk/Piper/Kokoro/
eSpeak alongside ElevenLabs. Local and cloud are different enough resource models that mixing
them read as confusing. Both `VoiceBrowserDialog` (Speech) and `SpeechSetupDialog` (Dictation)
already took their engine/provider list as a caller-supplied parameter, so the split is achieved
by constructing two instances of each with a filtered list rather than rewriting either dialog:
`VoiceBrowserDialog`'s `engine_options` is partitioned into the five offline engines and the one
(`elevenlabs`) online engine at the call site (`MainFrame.open_speech_hub`); `SpeechSetupDialog`
gained an `engine_scope: "all" | "offline" | "online"` parameter that filters
`build_engine_descriptors()`'s output. When no cloud dictation provider is registered — the
common case, since those arrive only via a transcription Quillin — Dictation (Online) shows a
plain explanatory message instead of attempting to build a dialog around an empty engine list
(a `wx.RadioBox` cannot hold zero choices).

**"Set as Default" is now explicit and reachable everywhere**, not just an implicit side effect
of closing the dialog. Read Aloud already applied the OK button's current engine+voice selection
as the default (`VoiceBrowserResult(action="select", ...)`); it now also has a dedicated
**Set as Default** button and a right-click context menu on the voice list
(`_do_set_default`/`_show_voice_context_menu`), so the choice can be made without closing the
dialog. Dictation previously had no equivalent for the *model* (only the engine, via the engine
radio switching `settings.speech_provider` as a side effect of any dispatched action) — a new
`speech_default_model_id` setting, a **Set as Default** button, and a matching context menu
(`_on_set_default`/`_show_model_context_menu` in `SpeechSetupDialog`) close that gap.
`SpeechCommandsMixin._default_model_id` (the one function every dictation/transcription/
captions call site funnels through to pick a model) now prefers `speech_default_model_id` when
it names a model that is actually installed, falling back to the catalog's recommended model
otherwise. The guided offline-speech picker (§ above) also writes both `speech_provider` and
`speech_default_model_id` automatically after a successful install, so downloading an engine +
model there is itself sufficient to make it the default — the explicit buttons are for changing
that choice later without re-running the picker.

Fixed in the same pass: `settings.speech_provider`'s valid-value set had never included
`"vosk"`, silently resetting it to `""` on load — harmless before Vosk was reachable from the
guided picker, a real bug once it was.

### 8.17 Status bar: the Message cell suppresses exact duplicates (0.9.0 Beta 2)

The generic **Message** cell (`_status_message`, e.g. "Ready", "Saved") is the one status bar
cell shown by default regardless of `status_bar_order`/`status_bar_hidden` — `_statusbar_items()`
(`quill/ui/main_frame_statusbar.py`) force-inserts it, and falls back to it alone when every
other cell is hidden. A user report surfaced a real gap in that always-on guarantee: Message can
end up showing the exact same text as another currently-visible cell (observed with the **Page**
cell), which reads as a confusing double-announcement rather than useful information. After the
rest of `_statusbar_items()` resolves the visible list, it now computes Message's own text
(`_statusbar_text_for_item("message")`) and compares it against every other visible cell's text;
an exact match drops Message from the list for that refresh. `any()` short-circuits on the first
match, so the (rare) no-match case is the only one that pays for computing every other visible
cell's text — and several cells already re-derive from the live document on every refresh (line/
column, page, word-count-family), so this is not a new class of cost, just one more consumer of
it. The rule is general (any cell pair), not hard-coded to Page specifically.

## 9. Accessibility, WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, and certification

Accessibility is not a feature set; it is the product's contract with its users. This section is the canonical reference for what "accessible" means for Quill, how it is engineered, how it is tested, how regressions are caught, and how a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) is generated for procurement.

### 9.1 Compliance posture and target standards

Quill targets the following standards in full at v1.0 release:

- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** (W3C Recommendation, October 2023). All Level A and AA Success Criteria that apply to a native desktop application are conformed to.
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AAA** for criteria reasonably achievable in a text editor (contrast 7:1 in High Contrast theme; reading-level alternatives; consistent help).
- **US Section 508** (revised 2018 ICT Refresh, which incorporates WCAG 2.0 AA). Conformance is established by demonstrating WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, which is a superset.
- **EN 301 549 v3.2.1** (European harmonised standard, including chapters 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 as applicable).
- **ARIA 1.2 / WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices** patterns are honoured wherever Quill exposes ARIA-equivalent semantics through MSAA/UIA (combobox patterns for the palette, treeview patterns for the Outline Navigator, listbox patterns for issue panels).
- **Microsoft's Accessibility Insights for Windows** baseline (every CI build is run through Accessibility Insights and must produce zero errors and zero warnings on covered axes).

**Screen-reader coverage across platforms.** On Windows, Quill targets **NVDA (primary), JAWS, and Narrator**; on **macOS** it targets **VoiceOver**. Quill routes its own announcements to the active platform screen reader and never speaks over it (on macOS it defers to VoiceOver rather than falling back to a separate speech engine). Embedded web content -- the Ask Quill chat, the Markdown/HTML preview, the About box, and the update/consent dialogs -- is driven through semantic HTML/ARIA so it reads as a real web document under NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver alike (see the accessible-WebView approach in section 10).

### 9.2 Conformance posture statement (will appear in the ACR)

> Quill 1.0 **supports** WCAG 2.2 Level A and Level AA across all functionality intended for end users. It **partially supports** Level AAA criteria 1.4.6 (Contrast Enhanced) and 2.4.10 (Section Headings). Quill does not include audio-only or video-only media; criteria specific to such media are **not applicable**.

### 9.3 WCAG 2.2 AA conformance matrix

The following matrix lists every Level A and AA Success Criterion, how Quill meets it, and where it is tested. Each row is a contract: a CI test exists for every “Tested by” entry, and a regression fails the build.

#### Principle 1: Perceivable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 | Non-text Content | A | Every icon-bearing button has a `wx.Window.SetName`/`SetHelpText` pair; the Accessibility Auditor (5.20) requires alt text on every image in user documents | UI a11y harness; auditor unit tests |
| 1.2.x | Time-based Media | A/AA | Not applicable; Quill ships no audio/video | n/a |
| 1.3.1 | Info and Relationships | A | Every label is associated with its control via parent-sizer convention plus explicit `SetLabel`; menu structure is exposed as MSAA tree; status-bar cells expose name+role+value+description | UI a11y harness verifies MSAA tree; snapshot tests |

| 1.4.3 | Contrast (Minimum) | AA | All bundled themes meet 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components; verified by an automated contrast checker run against every theme | Contrast CI job |
| 1.4.4 | Resize Text | AA | Editor font 10–48pt via `Ctrl++`/`Ctrl+-`/`Ctrl+0`; dialog text scales with Windows DPI (100–400%) without loss of function or clipping | DPI smoke tests at 100/125/150/175/200/300/400 |
| 1.4.5 | Images of Text | AA | Quill never renders text as an image; all UI text is real text in stock controls | n/a |

#### Principle 2: Operable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.1 | Keyboard | A | Every action is reachable from the keyboard; drag-and-drop is explicitly omitted from required flows | Keyboard parity matrix test |
| 2.1.2 | No Keyboard Trap | A | Every dialog has an Escape route; F6 cycles regions; modal dialogs have an explicit Cancel | Trap detection in pywinauto suite |
| 2.1.4 | Character Key Shortcuts | A | Single-character shortcuts (like F3) are bound only to commands that re-fire safely; users can rebind all of them; no single-letter shortcuts in editor focus | Keymap audit |

#### Principle 3: Understandable

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1.1 | Language of Page | A | The application's UI language is declared via `wx.Locale` and exposed to MSAA | Locale tests |

| 3.2.1 | On Focus | A | Focus changes never trigger unexpected context changes | Focus tests |
| 3.2.2 | On Input | A | Form inputs require explicit confirmation; no auto-submit on change | Form tests |
| 3.2.3 | Consistent Navigation | AA | Menu structure, palette prefixes, and status-bar layout are identical across every document and dialog | Snapshot tests |
| 3.2.4 | Consistent Identification | AA | The same icon and label is used for the same action everywhere | Inventory test |
| 3.2.6 | Consistent Help | A (new in 2.2) | Help menu position and Help item names are identical across every window | Snapshot tests |
| 3.3.1 | Error Identification | A | Every error message names the field and the rule violated; never just a code | Error message inventory |

| 3.3.8 | Accessible Authentication (Minimum) | AA (new in 2.2) | The only authentication is the AI provider API key, which is paste-and-store via DPAPI; no cognitive-test puzzle | n/a |

#### Principle 4: Robust

| SC | Title | Level | How Quill meets it | Tested by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1.1 | Parsing | A (obsolete in 2.2) | (Marked obsolete; included for completeness.) | n/a |
| 4.1.2 | Name, Role, Value | A | Every control exposes name, role, value, state, and where applicable description via MSAA and UIA. Custom status-bar cells implement this explicitly via `wx.Accessible` subclasses | UI a11y harness (Inspect.exe parity) |
| 4.1.3 | Status Messages | AA | All asynchronous announcements (saved, replaced N, found on line N, AI progress) are sent via the live-region pattern and through the SR-agnostic announcement channel (9.6) | Live region tests |

### 9.4 Screen-reader compatibility matrix

| Reader | Versions covered | Quill support level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVDA | 2024.x, 2025.x, 2026.x stable + current beta | First-class (reference platform) | All flows fully announced; no required scripts |
| JAWS | 2024, 2025, 2026 latest | First-class | Small optional script provides live-region parity for non-standard status-bar cell updates; ships in the installer |
| Narrator | Windows 11 24H2 and later | First-class | Uses UIA path; covered by the standard MSAA wiring |
| Windows Magnifier | Current | Supported | Focus following works because of stock controls |
| ZoomText / Fusion | Current | Supported | Tested but not officially certified at v1.0 |
| Dolphin SuperNova | Current | Best effort | Tested at major releases; defects escalated |

### 9.5 Screen-reader announcement architecture

Quill speaks to the user through three independent channels, all of which deliver the same content. This is what "never goes quiet when you needed it to speak" means in code.

1. **Stock control announcements** — wx widgets carry their own MSAA/UIA semantics; the SR speaks them automatically on focus and value change.
2. **Live region channel** — a hidden `wx.StaticText` per top-level window acts as an ARIA-like live region. Quill sets its text, fires an MSAA `EVENT_OBJECT_LIVEREGIONCHANGED` and a UIA `Notification` event with kind `Other` and priority `Standard` or `High` as appropriate. NVDA and Narrator pick this up natively; JAWS reads it through the bundled optional script.
3. **Direct SR APIs (graceful degradation)** — when a detected SR is running, Quill may use its direct API for higher-priority announcements (NVDA's `nvdaControllerClient.dll` `nvdaController_speakText`, JAWS' `jfwapi.dll` `JFWSayString`, Narrator via UIA notification). This is used only when the live region path is too slow for time-sensitive feedback (find result during F3 chaining, spell-check next misspelling). The direct call is preferred only when (a) a registered SR is detected and (b) the user has not opted out in Settings → Reading.

All three channels are funnelled through a single `quill.a11y.announce(text, *, priority='normal', interruptible=True)` function, so there is exactly one code path to test.

Quill exposes an explicit announcement backend selector in Settings and command surfaces. Supported modes are `auto`, `legacy`, `prism`, and `sounds`, with `auto` as default. `auto` chooses the best backend for the current screen-reader/runtime context and falls back deterministically when a backend is unavailable.

### 9.5.1 Announcement backend provenance

The `prism` backend in Quill is derived from the architecture and behavior patterns published in the open-source Prism project:

- Source: <https://github.com/ethindp/prism>
- Scope borrowed: screen-reader announcement abstraction approach, backend-oriented dispatch model, and parity-focused announcement reliability goals.
- Quill adaptation: integrated into Quill's existing `quill.a11y.announce(...)` funnel and profile/feature controls, while preserving Quill's own command, diagnostics, and privacy conventions.

### 9.6 Keyboard accessibility gates

- **Keyboard parity matrix**: every menu item, every status-bar cell, every palette command, every dialog button has a keyboard equivalent. CI generates the matrix from the command registry and fails the build if any entry lacks an accessible keystroke.
- **No keyboard traps**: pytest-pywinauto test traverses every modal and non-modal window and asserts that Escape, Tab, and Shift+Tab always exit or cycle.
- **Single-character shortcut policy**: single-character shortcuts (F3, F7, etc.) are only bound to commands marked `repeatable`. Editor focus never binds a single printable character because that would steal typing.
- **Two-key chord policy**: the default keymap uses at most six two-key chords; profiles can use more; the user can rebind all.
- **Screen-reader chord guard** (5.8.4): when the user captures a new keystroke, Quill checks it against a curated static list of well-known NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator chords and refuses the capture with an explanation.

### 9.7 Visual accessibility gates

- **Themes**: System (follows Windows), Light, Dark, High Contrast (follows Windows High Contrast tokens), Custom (user-defined token map).
- **Contrast**: every theme is verified by an automated contrast checker (`a11y/contrast.py` using the WCAG relative-luminance formula) against every text/background and component-state pair; build fails on any pair below 4.5:1 text or 3:1 component.
- **Font scaling**: editor font 10–48pt; dialog text follows Windows DPI; all layouts tested at 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 300%, 400%.
- **Reflow**: minimum supported window size 800x600; all dialogs scrollable at that size; status-bar cells overflow into the roll-up cell.
- **Motion**: respects Windows “Show animations” setting; no animations in any case; progress indicators use a determinate or simple textual percentage.
- **Focus visibility**: native Windows focus rectangle is preserved; High Contrast theme amplifies; no custom-drawn focus.
- **Cursor**: caret blink rate respects Windows; thickness respects Windows; no custom carets.
- **Spacing**: 1.4.12 user overrides honoured (see matrix).
- **Target size**: every clickable target ≥ 24x24 device-independent pixels; status-bar cells ≥ 28x24.

### 9.8 Cognitive accessibility gates

- **Consistent vocabulary**: a controlled vocabulary document drives every string (e.g. "document" not "file" or "buffer"; "selection" not "highlight"); enforced by a linter over translation source files.
- **Plain-language baseline**: UI strings target a Flesch reading ease of 60 or higher; Tools (the Document Statistics engine) is used in CI to grade the UI string corpus.
- **Confirmations on destructive actions**: every destructive action prompts; default button is the safe option (Cancel, Keep Mine, etc.); the destructive button is never the default.
- **Undo for everything possible**: every editor mutation is undoable; settings and keymap changes support “Undo last change” for 30 seconds via a Notifications-cell message.
- **One-key escape**: Esc closes any palette or dialog without side effects.
- **Tooltips with intent, not jargon**: every button tooltip names the action and the result, not the implementation.
- **No autoplay**: no audio, video, or animation starts without explicit user action.

### 9.9 Accessibility testing pipeline

Three layers run on every PR and every release branch.

1. **Static / lint layer (every PR)**
   - Controlled-vocabulary linter over `*.po` translation sources.
   - Plain-language linter (Flesch ≥ 60) over UI strings.
   - Keymap audit (no editor-focus single printable letters; all commands have ids).
   - Theme contrast checker.
   - Tab-order snapshot diff (changes require an explicit reviewer approval).
   - Command registry coverage (every command has a name, description, default keybinding or explicit `unbound`, and a help topic).
2. **Headless UI layer (every PR, runs on a Windows runner)**
   - `pytest` + `pywinauto` boots the app and walks every dialog, modal, and palette mode.
   - Inspect.exe parity: a custom UIA dumper records the tree for each window; the dump is diffed against a golden snapshot.
   - Accessibility Insights for Windows CLI is run; build fails on any error.
   - DPI smoke tests at 100/150/200%.
3. **SR-in-the-loop layer (every release branch and nightly)**
   - A custom SAPI 5 speech driver records every utterance into a transcript file.
   - NVDA is launched with the recording driver via NVDA's command-line; Quill is driven through a scripted scenario set (open, find, F3 chain, palette, outline jump, spell check fix, keymap rebind, restore backup, AI confirm-and-cancel).
   - The recorded transcript is diffed against a golden transcript per scenario per SR. The harness is in v1.1 of the project plan but the scenario scripts and golden transcripts are produced manually for v1.0.
   - JAWS scenarios run separately when a JAWS-enabled runner is available; Narrator runs via UIA notifications.

No PR merges with any of these failing. A failure can be waived only by the accessibility lead, with an issue link and an expiry date.

### 9.10 VPAT / ACR generation

- The conformance matrix in 9.3 is the source of truth.
- A script (`tools/gen_vpat.py`) renders the matrix into an ITI VPAT 2.5 Rev INT form (the ICT industry-standard template) and a Word document, plus a markdown ACR for the website.
- The ACR is published with every release and links each row back to the corresponding test.
- VPATs cover WCAG 2.2, Section 508, and EN 301 549.

### 9.11 Certification path

- v1.0 self-certifies WCAG 2.2 AA, Section 508 (revised), and EN 301 549 v3.2.1 via the ACR.
- An independent third-party audit (target: TPGi, Deque, or Level Access) is commissioned for v1.0 release. Findings are tracked publicly in a `compliance/` folder of the repository.
- Outstanding findings have target dates and a public regression register.

### 9.12 Gated regressions (CI must-pass list)

A build is blocked when any of the following regresses:

- Any cell in the WCAG matrix transitions from passing to failing.
- Any tab-order snapshot diff is unreviewed.
- Any contrast pair drops below threshold in any bundled theme.
- Any command in the registry loses a name, description, or keymap entry.
- Any dialog gains a keyboard trap.
- Any user-facing string fails the controlled-vocabulary or plain-language linter without an explicit waiver.
- Any custom control is introduced into the editor or palette path without an `wx.Accessible` subclass that passes the Inspect.exe parity test.
- Any SR transcript diff exceeds tolerance.

### 9.13 Dialog estate governance (DLG-3)

Every dialog in Quill is the single highest-risk accessibility surface in the UI: controls that do not work, focus landing on the wrong control, and rendering breakage all live in dialogs and are otherwise invisible to a source-only review. DLG-3 is the flagship structural-health refactor that makes the dialog estate correct by construction, source-of-truth, and machine-gated. It folds in and supersedes the earlier batch ambitions (the form-conversion wave and the individual AI-tool conversions).

**Surface policy (the non-negotiable standard).** Every dialog surface is exactly one of three sanctioned classifications, and no other dialog framework or bespoke modal surface may be introduced:

1. **`native`** — stock wx one-shot dialogs (`wx.MessageDialog`, `wx.RichMessageDialog`, `wx.MessageBox`, `wx.SingleChoiceDialog`, `wx.MultiChoiceDialog`, `wx.TextEntryDialog`, `wx.FileDialog`, `wx.DirDialog`, `wx.FindReplaceDialog`, `wx.ProgressDialog`, About). Native-first is the default for confirms, choices, simple text input, and file/folder selection.
2. **`web`** — sanctioned accessible web surfaces (`show_web_form`, the markdown/HTML preview dialog, the accessible chat view) used only where rich rendering, chat interaction, or dynamic multi-field forms are genuinely required, always with a native fallback.
3. **`hardened_custom`** — a `wx.Dialog` container composed _only_ of stock native controls (`wx.ListBox`, `wx.TextCtrl`, `wx.SearchCtrl`, `wx.CheckListBox`, `wx.Notebook`, `wx.Button`, …). These are "enhanced-native": real OS widgets in a dialog frame. No custom-drawn or owner-drawn controls are permitted in any dialog.

**Source-of-truth inventory.** The authoritative dialog inventory is generated from source, not from a checklist. `quill/tools/dialog_inventory.py` AST-scans all of `quill/**/*.py` and records every dialog surface under a stable, line-independent key (`<module>::<enclosing_qualname>::<kind>`) with its sanctioned classification. The committed snapshot is `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`, and two gates enforce it: `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py` fails on any new, moved, removed, or reclassified dialog or unsanctioned surface; and a registry cross-check inside the A11Y-4 banned-pattern gate fails the build on any unregistered or misclassified dialog. Adding a dialog forces a deliberate `python -m quill.tools.dialog_inventory --write` whose classification is reviewed in the diff. The manual companion checklist `dialogs.md` maps each shipped dialog to its keyboard command or menu path and is kept in sync, but it is not the inventory authority.

**Per-dialog accessibility interaction contract.** Every dialog must satisfy all of: deterministic initial focus on open; complete Tab / Shift+Tab traversal; an explicit default action (Enter); Escape/close always exits; preserved modal-result semantics; focus return to the initiating editor/control on close; the screen reader announces the title and every actionable control; and no trap, freeze, or silent state. Modal show is routed through the shared `dialog_contract` helpers (`apply_modal_ids`, `show_modal_dialog`), and raw `wx.Dialog(...)` always has a `Destroy()` (or `with` form) lifecycle and uses `wx.EXPAND` button sizers, never `wx.ALIGN_RIGHT`.

**Control-surface completeness.** For every dialog, every control surface is audited and explicitly dispositioned as **keep** (already excellent, evidence linked), **harden** (focus/tab/label/default/announcement improvements), or **replace** (native or sanctioned-web equivalent). No unlabeled, untabbable, unannounced, or ambiguous control remains.

**"Every dialog touched" definition.** A dialog counts as touched only when it has all three of: (1) a classification in the registry (`native`, `web`, or `hardened_custom`); (2) explicit conformance evidence (a focused source-contract test or behavior test); and (3) a confirmed `dialogs.md` mapping, updated if its naming, binding, or path changed. The authoritative inventory is generated from source — including non-`quill/ui` surfaces such as the startup storage chooser in `quill/__main__.py` and the nested describe-image source/file pickers in `quill/ui/main_frame_image.py` — so checklist-only review can never miss a surface. The exit criterion is 100% source coverage, not a fixed legacy count; the count is expected to rise as source-discovered dialogs are folded in.

**High-risk clusters (sequenced first).** The concentration of lifecycle/focus risk is known and drives wave order: (1) `main_frame.py` modal sprawl (largest concentration); (2) `assistant_tools.py` (high interaction complexity, async actions, many custom dialog classes); (3) the startup/onboarding chain (`run_startup_wizard`, first-run prompts, trust consent, web-preview handoff); (4) sticky notes (historical focus-landing issues); and (5) mixed rendering surfaces (native + web + fallback) where behavior parity must be explicitly pinned. Already in place and relied upon: the shared `dialog_contract.py` modal helpers, the banned-pattern gate's existing `wx.ALIGN_RIGHT` and raw-`wx.Dialog` destroy-path checks, and the existing behavior tests for preview, web-form, and onboarding navigation.

**Execution waves.** DLG-3 proceeds as: Phase 0 — authoritative source-generated registry + gates (delivered); Phase 1 — strengthened A11Y-4 static guard (delivered); Phase 2 — native conversion wave for hand-rolled dialogs that are really a single confirm / choice / text prompt, replaced with the stock one-shot equivalent, preserving all user-facing wording and outcomes; Phase 3 — enhanced-native standardization wave converging the genuinely multi-control dialogs onto one focus/default/lifecycle grammar via the shared contract (never flattened into one-shots where that would lose live search, lists, or streaming); Phase 4 — web-surface standardization only where rich rendering or dynamic forms are justified, with native-fallback parity and no raw HTML dumped into document tabs in onboarding/welcome paths; Phase 5 — startup/onboarding hardening (wizard, first-run, trust consent, crash recovery) for deterministic focus across chained modals, preserving the explicit-consent requirements and retiring the screen-reader startup-crash path; Phase 6 — assistant/AI tool dialog consolidation (`assistant_tools.py`, `ai_model_panel.py`, `train_style_dialog.py`, `assistant_panel.py`) onto the same modal/focus/error contract with safe async/"busy" semantics; Phase 7 — CQ-16 characterization expansion around dialog-launch command paths (return values and side effects) before any CQ-1 decomposition; Phase 8 — manual NVDA baseline, JAWS spot (startup, assistant, sticky notes, watch profiles), and Narrator sanity passes across `dialogs.md`, each row carrying pass/fail evidence.

**Dialog-by-dialog coverage map (no section exempt).** Every checklist family in `dialogs.md` is in scope with a default disposition: file/session dialogs (native-flow normalization + modal/focus hardening); settings/customization/dialog-launch surfaces (enhanced-native consistency — menu editor, settings, command palette); navigation dialogs (keep stock/input surfaces, harden bookmark/list/tree flows); text-analysis dialogs (normalize spell/lookup/thesaurus list workflows); accessibility-tools dialogs (focus/read-order consistency in results dialogs); intake/report dialogs (standardized preview/report modals); read-aloud/OCR dialogs (keep the OCR review contract, harden nested chooser flows); sticky-notes dialogs (retain web-form where justified, harden vault/list/editor transitions); external-tools/format dialogs (enhanced-native standard patterns); compare dialogs (consistent list/option/preview focus); keymap dialogs (stock controls + predictable nested edit flow); appearance/backup/import dialogs (import/export previews and file-picker transitions hardened); watch-folder dialogs (nested editor/browse/preview paths hardened); notifications dialog (standardized close/default semantics); formatting dialogs (preserve `show_web_form` for Insert Link, harden list/YAML nested flows); macros dialogs (text-entry + management standardization); AI/assistant dialogs (the DLG-2 conversions folded in); BITS speech dialogs (provider/model/status contract hardening); feature/profile dialogs (profile-switch, health, and management consistency); help/startup/support dialogs (wizard/about/diagnostics/report-bug rendering and focus safety); selection-action dialogs (action-chooser semantics hardened); nested/secondary dialogs (explicit coverage for each path launched from a parent); power-tools dialogs (stock prompt/confirm consistency); and startup-only dialogs (crash recovery + untrusted-location remain top-priority hardened native flows).

**Conversion decisions (definitive).** Keep `native`: simple confirms and binary prompts, and stable stock file/folder/select/text prompts. Keep sanctioned `web`: markdown/HTML preview and rich rendered content, explicit multi-field forms where `show_web_form` is already stable and fallback-backed, and chat-centric surfaces with native fallback. Harden `hardened_custom` (not a web rewrite by default): complex list/CRUD/picker dialogs where stock controls are appropriate and lower-risk than a web migration, and interaction-heavy assistant panels that are not rich-rendering-centric. No untouched custom paths: any retained custom dialog must carry a written rationale plus a contract test.

**Operational mandates (enforcement, not intent).** Machine-enforced checks that must pass before merge: the expanded A11Y-4 banned-pattern gate with zero violations; the dialog-registry completeness check (no orphan dialogs); the source-contract tests for touched dialogs; the characterization checks for dialog-launch command paths; and the project-wide source-scan check (no dialog constructor or call-site outside the inventory). "Manual QA later" is never a substitute for these gates. Manual accessibility verification is release-blocking per touched family: a keyboard-only pass (open, traverse, act, cancel, close, focus return), a screen-reader pass (NVDA baseline; JAWS/Narrator spot by risk), a nested-flow pass (child dialogs launched from parents), and a fallback-parity pass (web-backed dialogs validated in native fallback). Every dialog change records its impacted dialog id(s), the control surfaces touched, the classification decision, the tests added/updated, and the manual verification result; missing evidence means the change is incomplete.

**Anti-regression controls.** No mixed ad-hoc modal patterns may be introduced during the refactor; no dialog merges without a classification and test evidence; and no `dialogs.md` drift is allowed in a PR. The source-of-truth rule is absolute: before closing any dialog work item, run the inventory scanner across the entire `quill` package, and if scanner output and the committed registry disagree, the work is incomplete regardless of checklist status.

**Definition of done.** DLG-3 is done only when: 100% of source-scanned dialogs are touched and classified (not just a legacy checklist count); simple confirm/message/choice/text flows are native one-shots; rich/input flows use only sanctioned web surfaces with fallback parity; every control in every dialog is inventoried and dispositioned (`keep`/`harden`/`replace`); any retained `hardened_custom` dialog has an explicit rationale and at least one focused source-contract or behavior test; the strengthened A11Y-4 guard blocks contract regressions; the startup wizard and first-run chains are stable and non-crashing with a screen reader active on Windows and macOS; and `dialogs.md` is synchronized with the final command paths and nested flows.

### 10.2 Complete dependency manifest

Every direct dependency is listed below with the pinned version range Quill 1.0 will ship against, the license, the reason it is in the tree, and any constraints. Pins are tight in production builds and loose in development.

#### 10.2.1 Runtime, Python

| Package | Version | License | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `python` | 3.12.x | PSF | Runtime | Frozen with PyInstaller; 3.13 supported as soon as wxPython publishes wheels |

#### 10.2.4 License posture

- Quill itself is **MIT-licensed** (default; final decision still tracked in Open Questions).
- LGPL components (`odfpy`, `chardet`, `liblouis`) are linked dynamically; we publish the license texts and a `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` in the installer.
- MPL-2.0 components (`cyhunspell`, `pikepdf`) are linked dynamically; modifications to those files (if any) are published.
- AGPL components (`ebooklib`) are used as a library; we do not host a network service that exposes their interface to end users, which keeps us outside the AGPL trigger.
- All licenses are aggregated automatically into `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` by `tools/gen_notices.py` at build time; the build fails if any new package lacks a license entry.

### 10.3 Per-feature technical specifications

### 10.4 Threading and concurrency model

- **UI thread**: owns all wx widgets and the editor buffer. Never blocks for more than 16 ms.
- **I/O thread pool** (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, default 4): file open, save, autosave, backup writes, settings persistence, bookmark writes, fingerprint compute.
- **Compute thread pool** (default 2): spell-check background pass, outline build for very large documents, document statistics for >1 MB, accessibility audit for >100 KB.
- **asyncio loop** (via `wxasync`): all HTTP I/O (AI providers, Open from URL, update check). Cancellable per task.
- **OCR worker process**: Tesseract runs in a child process per OCR job, isolated to avoid GIL contention and crash blast radius.
- **Marshalling**: any callback into wx uses `wx.CallAfter` or `wx.CallLater`. No direct cross-thread wx calls.
- **Cancellation**: every long-running task accepts a `quill.core.events.CancelToken`. Cancellation is checked at fixed safe points (every page, every 1 MB of read, every HTTP chunk).
- **Backpressure**: the I/O pool uses bounded queues; new tasks wait, never spawn-and-forget.
- **No threading.Lock around shared mutable state in `core`**. The document model is owned by the UI thread; workers receive snapshots and return new snapshots; `wx.CallAfter` merges. This invariant is enforced by lint (`ruff` custom rule) that flags `threading.Lock` outside `platform/`.

### 10.5 Data layout (canonical)

```

All JSON files validate against schemas in `quill/core/schemas/`. All writes are atomic (`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` in the same directory + `os.replace`).

### 10.6 Packaging, signing, supply chain

- **Frozen build**: PyInstaller with one-folder layout (faster start than one-file). UPX disabled (no compression; SmartScreen friendliness, debug symbols intact).
- **Installer**: Inno Setup 6 with per-user (`{userappdata}`) default, system-wide optional. Components: Core, Tesseract OCR (English by default; additional languages downloadable post-install), Hunspell dictionaries (launch-language set by default), JAWS script (optional). License screen lists `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.
- **Portable zip**: identical layout without registry writes; uses `%APPDATA%` per Windows convention.
- **Signing**: EV code-signing certificate; `signtool` signs every `.exe`, `.dll`, and the installer; timestamps via DigiCert RFC 3161 timestamp server. SmartScreen reputation built before public launch.
- **Reproducible builds**: the build pipeline pins every dependency via `uv` lockfile; the lockfile is committed; the build container is pinned to a SHA-tagged Windows image.
- **SBOM**: a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM is generated per build (`tools/gen_sbom.py` using `pip-audit --format=cyclonedx`) and attached to the GitHub release.
- **Supply-chain scanning**: every PR runs `pip-audit` and `osv-scanner`; CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities fail the build.
- **Provenance**: GitHub Actions runs with OIDC; artefacts are signed with Sigstore `cosign` and the `cosign.bundle` is published next to each release artefact.
- **Update channel**: a signed JSON manifest (Ed25519 signature; key pinned in the app) lists current stable, beta, and security-only releases with SHA-256s. Quill checks on launch only when the user has opted in (manual `Check for Updates` is always available).
- **Footprint**: realistic target is 180–220 MB installed with English Tesseract data and English/UK + Spanish/French/German Hunspell dictionaries. A **Quill Lite** option ships at ~90 MB and downloads dictionaries and Tesseract on first use.

### 10.7 Build and dev environment

- **Python 3.12** pinned via `uv python install`.
- **Lockfile**: `uv.lock` committed; `uv sync` reproduces the dev environment exactly.
- **Dev install**: `uv sync --all-extras` plus `pre-commit install` for hooks.
- **Pre-commit**: ruff format, ruff lint, mypy on `core/` and `io/`, controlled-vocabulary linter, contrast checker, tab-order snapshot check, license-notice generator.
- **Local accessibility audit**: `python -m quill.tools.a11y_audit` launches Quill under pywinauto and runs the static + headless layers in under five minutes.
- **Local SR scenario**: `python -m quill.tools.sr_scenario --scenario find_chain --reader nvda` launches NVDA against Quill, replays a scenario, and writes a transcript to `out/`.

### 10.8 Continuous integration and delivery

- **Provider**: GitHub Actions.
- **Matrix**: Windows 10 22H2, Windows 11 24H2; Python 3.12; wxPython current stable.
- **Jobs**:
  1. **Lint** (ruff, mypy, jsonschema validation of bundled schemas).
  2. **Unit tests** (`pytest tests/unit -n auto`).
  3. **Integration tests** (`pytest tests/integration`); covers every format reader and writer against a fixture corpus stored in Git LFS.
  4. **A11y static** (controlled vocab, plain language, keymap audit, contrast checker, tab-order snapshot diff).
  5. **A11y headless** (`pytest tests/a11y` via pywinauto + Accessibility Insights CLI).
  6. **Perf smoke** (`pytest tests/perf`, asserts the targets in §11).
  7. **Build** (PyInstaller, Inno Setup, signtool, Sigstore cosign).
  8. **Supply chain** (pip-audit, osv-scanner, SBOM generation).
  9. **SR scenario nightly** (NVDA scenarios on a self-hosted runner).
- **Release branch**: `release/x.y` triggers a full build + sign + publish to GitHub Releases and the auto-update manifest.
- **Triage SLA**: SR transcript diffs reviewed within 24 hours.

### 10.9 Observability

- **Logging**: stdlib `logging`, rotating file handler, INFO level by default. Log records contain action name, outcome, duration; never document content; paths are hashed.
- **Crash handler**: a `faulthandler`-based hook writes a `quill-crash-YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.dump` with the Python traceback and a redacted environment snapshot. On next launch Quill offers to include the crash in a diagnostics bundle for support; never auto-sends.
- **Metrics**: opt-in only; counters per feature use; transported by `httpx` to a self-hosted endpoint over TLS; cleartext example shown before opt-in.
- **Event bus**: an internal sync event bus (`core.events`) records the last 50 commands and notable lifecycle events; these are what Help → Save Diagnostics ships.

### 10.10 Plugin runtime (v1.0 surface, v1.1 full)

- **v1.0**: the plugin loader skeleton exists; only first-party plugins (JAWS script, additional Hunspell dictionaries) are loadable. The full third-party plugin runtime ships in v1.1.
- **Manifest** (`plugin.json`): id, name, version, license, capabilities (`commands`, `format_reader`, `format_writer`, `palette_entry`, `settings_page`, `keybinding_default`, `statusbar_cell`), requested permissions (`network: never|on_action`, `filesystem: read|write`, `subprocess: none|listed`).
- **Discovery**: `%APPDATA%\Quill\plugins\<id>\plugin.json` plus `entry_points` group `quill.plugins` (for pip-installed plugins).
- **Lifecycle**: load → register → enable; disabled plugins keep their settings.
- **Sandboxing (v1.1)**: each plugin runs in its own thread; network and subprocess calls require an explicit per-action consent or a setting that whitelists the plugin's manifest-declared hosts; UI surfaces created by plugins must pass the same accessibility static checks as core.
- **Versioning**: plugins declare the Quill API version they target; the loader rejects mismatched majors.

### 10.11 Security architecture

- **Secrets**: AI provider keys and remote site passwords are stored via Windows Credential Manager where available, with DPAPI-encrypted fallback (`platform.windows.dpapi`) when vault APIs are unavailable; never in plain text on disk; never logged; never in diagnostics bundles. macOS builds use the Keychain facade at `platform.macos.keychain`.
- **Document data**: never leaves the machine without per-action consent.
- **Network calls**: an internal `ai.safety.consent(action, host, size_estimate)` gate is required before any network call; the call records what was sent (action name, host, size only) in the audit log. Remote I/O is inventoried in `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py`; a new transport call site without a written rationale is a CI failure.
- **Untrusted XML**: S3 and WebDAV listings are routed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring`. Documents that declare a DTD or custom entity (billion-laughs, XXE) are refused with a friendly `RemoteTransportError` and never reach the parser.
- **Updates**: manifest signature verified with a pinned Ed25519 public key; artefact SHA-256 verified before install.
- **File handling**: file dialogs use the OS dialog (`wx.FileDialog`) so the user controls disclosure scope; the trusted-locations system (5.31) prevents silent opening of suspicious files.
- **Path traversal**: every settings/keymap/plugin path is normalised and validated; no `..` segments accepted.
- **JSON parsing**: bounded depth and size via custom decoder hooks; refuses to parse settings files over 10 MB or beyond depth 32.
- **YAML parsing**: `safe_load` only.
- **Subprocess**: limited to Tesseract and (post-v1.1) plugin-declared binaries; arguments are always passed as lists; no `shell=True`.
- **Threat model**: a malicious document might try to (a) crash the parser, (b) request a keymap override to bind dangerous keys, (c) trigger an outbound network request. (a) parsers are fuzz-tested with `atheris`; (b) keymap overrides require explicit consent (5.50); (c) network is gated.
- **Responsible disclosure**: a `SECURITY.md` file documents the disclosure email and PGP key.

### 10.12 Update mechanism

- v1.0 ships **manual update check**: `Help → Check for Updates…` fetches the signed manifest, verifies it, compares versions, offers to download the next stable.
- The download is verified (SHA-256) and Sigstore-attested; the installer is signed; the user runs it.
- The asset download streams in fixed-size chunks and reports progress through an accessible callback, so screen-reader users hear coarse, non-spammy progress announcements (for example 25/50/75 percent) instead of a silent wait.
- After a successful download Quill presents an **Update downloaded** dialog offering, as available, **Install now…** (Windows `.exe`/`.msi`), **Open the containing folder**, or **Close**. Install-now runs the in-app pre-update health check first.
- **Portable installs update to the portable build, not the installer.** When QUILL is running as a verified portable bundle (`quill.core.updates.running_portable()`), Check for Updates skips the signed-manifest path (that feed carries only the installer URL) and uses the GitHub releases path, where `_pick_asset` selects the portable `.zip` asset — matched by name so the unrelated delta `*-update-windows.zip` is never chosen. The downloaded `.zip` is non-runnable, so the Update downloaded dialog offers **Open the containing folder** rather than Install now. Installed copies continue to receive the installer exactly as before.
- The update-available dialog includes a **Skip this version** action; a skipped version is remembered and suppressed on silent launch checks until a newer version appears or the user checks manually.
- **Token self-heal (#919 runtime complement).** The update offer is gated on token presence, not version alone: if a running build is missing its bundled bug-report token (`quill.core.feedback_token.github_token_present()` is false), Check for Updates offers the latest release even at the same version, with a dialog whose header reads "Restore the bug-report token: {version}" and whose notes explain the reinstall restores the token (so "update to the version you already have" is not confusing). A silent background check does **not** auto-download the same version — it records a notification ("A build that restores the bug-report token is available. Use Check for Updates to install it.") and sets the status to "Update available (restores bug-report token)", leaving the reinstall to an explicit Check for Updates. **Skip this version** silences the offer, and it stops the moment the token is present again. This is the runtime complement to the build-time "every build ships the token, no opt-out" hardening (§5.x, #919): the build gate prevents a new tokenless ship, and the update offer recovers a build that already slipped through tokenless.
- Silent launch checks are throttled to at most once per 24 hours (recorded via the last-check timestamp); a manual `Check for Updates` always runs regardless of the throttle.
- A small in-app pre-update health check ensures the user's editor has no unsaved documents before launching the installer.
- Auto-update lands in v1.1 with a Squirrel-style delta channel.

### 10.13 Internationalisation infrastructure

- All UI strings flow through `gettext`; the `_()` callable is the sole permitted lookup.
- `.po` source files live under `quill/ui/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`; `.mo` are compiled at build time.
- Pluralisation uses `ngettext`.
- Date/number formatting uses `babel`.
- Bidirectional text in user documents is rendered by the OS edit control; full RTL UI is v1.2.
- A translation portal (Weblate or Crowdin) is set up at v1.0 beta; community translators are credited in About and release notes. **Status:** the pipeline is proven end to end — the first community translation, **Italian** (Elena Brescacin, 100% coverage, 0.9.0 beta), shipped through the documented PO workflow and CI gates; credited in About (contributors list), the release notes, CHANGELOG, and `docs/translations/translating.md`.
- Translation operations follow a documented contributor plan with:
  - gettext `POT -> PO -> MO` workflow,
  - translator comments and placeholder-preservation rules,
  - beta translation push and pre-release string freeze,
  - CI quality gates for extraction, syntax, compile, and placeholder validation.
- Contributor process and policy reference: `docs/translating.md`.

### 10.14 Performance budgets and instrumentation

All performance targets in §11 are enforced by `tests/perf/`. Each test asserts against a budget; regressions over 15% fail the build. Microbenchmarks live next to the code they measure. Real-world startup time is measured by a stopwatch fixture that uses Windows' high-resolution timer.

### 10.15 Coding standards and review

- **Style**: ruff format (PEP 8 with relaxed line length 100).
- **Typing**: strict mypy in `core/` and `io/`; gradual in `ui/`; types required on all public functions.
- **Docstrings**: Google style; every public API has one.
- **Imports**: absolute; no wildcard imports; `wx` may only be imported from `quill.ui` and `quill.platform.windows`.
- **Public API stability**: `quill.core`, `quill.io`, `quill.plugins.api` follow semver; breaking changes require a major bump and a deprecation cycle of one minor version.
- **PR review**: two approvals required; one must be from a maintainer; any change to `ui/`, `core/a11y/`, or `core/keymap.py` additionally requires sign-off from the accessibility lead.
- **Issue triage SLA**: P0 (data loss, crash on launch, accessibility regression) within 24 h; P1 (function broken) within 5 business days; P2 within the next release.

### 10.16 Module ownership and SOLID boundaries

- `core/*` knows nothing about `wx`; tested without UI; can be reused by a future TUI or web front-end.
- `io/*` modules each export `read(path) -> Document`, optionally `write(doc, path)`, and `outline(doc) -> Outline | None`; no other contracts.
- `ui/*` modules consume the command registry and the document model; UI components never read from disk directly.
- `platform/windows/*` is the only place where `pywin32`, `comtypes`, or registry access is allowed.
- `ai/*` modules conform to a single `Provider` ABC with `complete`, `improve_reading_order`, `cancel`, `estimate_cost` methods.
- `plugins/api.py` is the only file plugins import from; everything else is internal.

### 10.17 Magic, by construction

The engineering choices above add up to the user-visible magic the product promises:

- Stock controls everywhere keep MSAA/UIA pristine; speech is correct without scripts.
- Atomic writes plus `.bak` plus autosave plus persistent undo make "I lost work" almost impossible.
- A single announcement funnel keeps speech behaviour identical across NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator.
- Pinned, audited dependencies and reproducible builds keep "works on my machine" out of the loop.
- A small command registry plus a three-layer keymap plus a discoverable palette mean every feature is reachable, learnable, and rebindable.
- A WCAG matrix wired to CI means accessibility cannot quietly regress; if it slips, the build fails.

## 11. Performance targets

- Cold start to blank document: under 1.5 seconds on a 2020-era laptop.
- Open a 200-page text-based PDF (local extraction): under 6 seconds.
- Open a 1 MB Markdown file: under 250 ms.
- Find first match in a 1 MB document: under 100 ms.
- Spell check full document (50 000 words, en-GB): under 1.2 seconds.
- Quick-fix suggestion ranking per misspelling: under 10 ms.
- Command palette open + first results visible: under 50 ms.
- Memory at idle with one empty document: under 150 MB.
- Autosave write: under 50 ms, non-blocking.

---

## 12. Privacy and security

- Local first. Nothing leaves the machine without an explicit per-action confirmation.
- AI provider keys stored via Windows Credential Manager when available, with DPAPI-encrypted fallback; never plain text.
- **Remote site passwords** (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3) follow the same three-tier ladder: **Windows Credential Manager → DPAPI-protected JSON under `%APPDATA%\Quill\` → macOS Keychain facade**. Plain-text on disk is never the path of last resort.
- Logs never include document content. Logs include action names and outcomes only.
- Spell-check learning data stays on disk under the user profile and can be wiped from a single button.
- Crash reports are opt-in and scrubbed of paths and content.
- All file dialogs use the OS dialog so the user controls disclosure.
- **Remote I/O gating.** Every outbound call site is inventoried in `quill/tools/network_egress_audit.py` with a written rationale. A new transport call that is not added to that inventory is a CI failure. Cloud endpoints (S3, HTTPS, WebDAV-over-HTTPS) must use TLS; FTPS is enforced when available. Verified TLS context (`quill.core.net.verified_ssl_context`) is used for every HTTPS request.
- **Untrusted-XML protection.** S3 and WebDAV listings are parsed through `quill.core.safe_xml.fromstring`, which routes through `defusedxml` and refuses any document that declares a DTD or custom entity. The transport layer translates both parse errors and unsafe-XML refusals into a typed `RemoteTransportError` so the screen reader announces a single, friendly message.
- Network calls show host, payload size, and estimated cost (where the provider supplies it) before sending.
- Startup includes a trust/privacy/responsible-AI consent acknowledgement before guided onboarding continues.

---

## 13. Internationalisation and localisation

- All UI strings wrapped in `_()` from `gettext`.
- Initial languages: English (US), English (UK), Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Japanese.
- Right-to-left support deferred to v1.2.
- Spell-check dictionaries shipped for the initial languages plus a downloader for others.

---

## 14. Telemetry

- Off by default. The setting is presented in plain language, with an example payload shown verbatim before opt-in.
- If enabled, anonymised counters only: feature used, error counts.

---

## 15. Success metrics

- Time to open a typical PDF and reach the first searchable word.
- Number of screen-reader announcement regressions per release (target: zero).
- Crash-free sessions per week (target: 99.5 percent).
- User-reported "I lost work" incidents (target: zero, hard).
- Spell-check first-suggestion acceptance rate after 30 days of use (target: above 70 percent).
- Command palette task completion time vs menu navigation (target: at least 2x faster for top 20 commands).
- Adoption: monthly active users among the NVDA add-on community.
- Qualitative: 20+ unsolicited testimonials in the first 6 months saying "this feels calm."

## 16. Release plan

v1.0 is locked to features we can build and ship at the highest quality bar with no novel research dependencies and no fragile third-party requirements. Anything that requires unproven libraries, brittle parsers, ML training, or external binaries beyond the bundled set is deferred to the backlog in [section 17](#17-backlog-and-deferred-items).

Every v1.0 feature in the list below is **Confidence A**: a defined library exists, a known engineering path is mapped, accessibility behaviour is predictable, and a working prototype can be produced in a single sprint.

---

## 17. Backlog and deferred items

> **Plan of record.** The authoritative, continuously-updated view of all open work — workstreams (shipped/open), phase outcomes, the release gap list, and the open-issue ledger — lives in [`docs/planning/roadmap.md`](../../planning/roadmap.md). (Shipped workstreams' specs — offline speech-to-text #617, the braille suite, batch document-to-speech, Structured List Studio, the verbosity system, the ElevenLabs integration, and Table Studio (now PRD §5.4.14) — were retired to git history once delivered; their status lives in the roadmap and user guide, and the verbosity 2.0 backlog is consolidated in roadmap §6.) The current direction is that these items **ship** (the older 2.0-deferral framing is dropped); the tables below are retained as the format-support reference.

Everything below is intentionally out of v1.0. Each item is either yellow (achievable but requires more engineering than the v1.0 quality bar permits in time) or red (depends on unstable third-party formats, large native dependencies, or research-flavoured uplift we will not promise without measurement).

The organising principle is simple: **v1.0 ships only Confidence A. Confidence B and C land in v1.1–1.3 behind opt-in plugins and feature flags, with quality grades shown to the user.**

### 17.1 Format support deferred to plugins (v1.1+)

| Format | Why deferred | Target plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy Word `.doc`, PowerPoint `.ppt`, Excel `.xls` | Need headless LibreOffice for high quality; LibreOffice is a ~300 MB dependency | LibreOffice Bridge |
| WordPerfect `.wpd`, Works `.wps`, Windows Write `.wri`, StarOffice | Python bindings flaky on Windows; covered well by headless LibreOffice | LibreOffice Bridge |
| Apple iWork `.pages`, `.key`, `.numbers` | Modern iWork is a proprietary IWA archive; coverage is partial | iWork Bridge (best-effort) |
| OneNote `.one` | Closed format, no stable open library | OneNote Bridge via Microsoft Graph (requires sign-in) |
| Kindle `.azw3`, `.mobi`, FB2, LIT, LRF, PRC, PDB, TCR | Best handled by Calibre's conversion engine | Calibre Bridge |
| Kindle `.kfx` | DRM-protected by design; Quill will not break DRM | Calibre Bridge (user must already have a DRM-stripped copy) |
| DjVu | Native `djvulibre` dependency; installer weight | DjVu Plugin |
| Comics `cbz`, `cbr` | RAR (`cbr`) requires non-free `unrar.dll` | Comics Plugin |
| PostScript `ps`, `eps` | Needs Ghostscript native binary | PostScript Plugin |
| XPS, OXPS | Niche; needs additional reader | XPS Plugin |
| MSG, PST, MBOX | `libpff` works but coverage on encrypted/corporate PSTs is uneven | Mail Bridge |
| Web archives WARC, WACZ, `.webarchive` | Format zoo; useful but not ubiquitous | Web Archive Plugin |
| Parquet, Feather | Niche analyst use; large native deps | Data Files Plugin |
| EVTX, ETL | Native Windows log formats; niche audience | Logs Plugin |
| HEIC, AVIF, JP2 | Native binary dependencies (`pillow-heif`, `pillow-avif-plugin`) | Modern Images Plugin |
| Chat exports (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, Zoom, Otter, ChatGPT) | Export formats churn 2–4 times per year; requires ongoing maintenance | Chat Exports Plugin (independently versioned) |
| OneNote, Evernote `.enex`, Bear, Simplenote | Mixed formats; per-app quirks | Notes Bridge Plugin |
| Audio + transcript pair playback | Needs media playback; out of scope for core editor | Audio Transcript Plugin |

### 17.2 Features deferred

- **Spell-check contextual reranker.** Ships as opt-in experimental in v1.1 once measured uplift over Hunspell-alone is demonstrated on a labelled corpus.
- **Per-paragraph automatic language detection** for the spell-check dictionary stack. Short paragraphs and code-mixed text make this unreliable today.
- **Tier-2 "enhanced local" PDF extractor.** No pure-Python local layout analyser meets the bar. v1.0 ships tier 1 (local) and tier 3 (opt-in AI). A real tier 2 returns when there is a credible local model.
- **PDF heading synthesis from font-size analysis** when no embedded bookmarks exist. Available as an opt-in experimental switch but not promoted in v1.0.
- **Auto-update.** v1.0 ships manual update check with signed manifest. Squirrel-style auto-update lands in v1.1.
- **NVDA speech-viewer CI harness.** No supported automation API; we will build a test driver in v1.1.
- **Dynamic screen-reader shortcut introspection.** v1.0 uses a curated static list of well-known NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator chords; explains conflicts using that list. Dynamic introspection of user-customised SR bindings remains out of scope (no public API).
- **Right-to-left UI.** v1.2.
- **Project workspaces and Find in Folder.** v1.2.
- **Multi-cursor / column selection.** Not planned; conflicts with screen-reader navigation patterns.
- **History panel (visual undo stack).** Backlog.
- **Macro recording and playback.** Backlog.
- **Linked-notes / wikilink editor.** Backlog.
- **Per-file-class backup retention policy.** v1.0 ships a single global retention rule (5.13). v1.1 introduces per-format-class defaults (e.g. 100 backups for source code, 25 for long-form documents) once we have telemetry on user save patterns.
- **Single-line compose box mode.** A small, screen-reader-optimised composer dialog whose Enter sends back to the main editor at the cursor. Useful for slow-speech users; needs user testing to confirm it is worth the surface area. Backlog for v1.1.
- **Advanced model lifecycle in core app flow.** Quill now ships a local Writing Assistant shell, prompt presets, generated tool catalog, assistant onboarding, AI Hub entry point, Prompt Studio custom templates, Agent Center guided plans, AI connection preferences, connection verification/model discovery actions, searchable model selection, provider-aware guided recommendations, AI menu status-detail feedback, and sandboxed Python runner. Connection diagnostics use a structured error taxonomy that separates authentication failure (HTTP 401) from permission/access denial (HTTP 403), rate limiting, warm-up/not-ready states, local-server-not-running, and unreachable endpoints, with a bounded warm-up retry/backoff so a model that is still loading is reported as warming up rather than failed. The status taxonomy is matched on numeric status codes rather than substring matching, so host ports such as `localhost:11403` cannot be misread as a 403. Broader built-in model catalog lifecycle and background prefetch policy remain future work.

### 17.4 Explicitly out of scope for Quill (any version unless re-evaluated)

Quill is opinionated about what it is _not_. The following are intentionally and permanently out of scope unless a future PRD revision re-opens the question.

- **Visual word-processor styling in the editor.** No bold/italic/colour as direct formatting. Quill is screen-reader-first; users who want WYSIWYG should use Word. Markdown supports inline emphasis textually.
- **Real-time collaborative editing.** Not in v1.x. The architecture does not preclude it; we are not committing to it.
- **Cloud-sync of documents.** Sync is for keymap and settings only (8.8). Document storage stays on the user's machine and chosen cloud-drive folder.
- **Mobile, web, macOS, or Linux ports.** Cross-platform is post-v2 at earliest. The `core/` layer has no `wx` so it remains _possible_, not _committed_.
- **Voice input / dictation.** Dictation is the offline, on-device Whisper stack (Locked Dictation; the Windows/SAPI path was removed). Voice control of QUILL itself shipped in 0.9.0 as **Hey QUILL** (Tools > Speech; full reference in the user guide's "Voice Interaction"): **Voice Command (Offline)** push-to-talk, **Voice Conversation Mode** (a follow-up-window loop with nine retunable audio cues and VAD silence detection), and **Listen for "Hey QUILL"** always-listening wake word. Every mode runs recognition entirely on-device, is bounded by the agent safe-tool allowlist so a misheard phrase cannot do damage, is off by default, and is off in Safe Mode; the always-listening mode shows a live-mic indicator with a periodic spoken reminder. Always-on listening without those explicit opt-ins stays out of scope.
- **AI authoring assistant.** The current build exposes a local Writing Assistant shell, prompt presets, Prompt Studio reusable prompt templates, Agent Center guided profiles, AI Hub launch surface, AI connection preferences (Ollama local/cloud, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, Gemini, custom OpenAI-compatible), provider verification/model discovery, searchable model filtering, status-detail accessibility announcements, and a sandboxed Python tool. The quick writing actions (Rewrite Selection, Summarize Selection, Continue Writing, Fix Grammar) each guard on the AI-enabled setting regardless of entry point (menu, command palette, or keybinding) and fall back to a sensible scope when there is no selection (paragraph at cursor for rewrite/grammar, whole document for summarize), announcing the chosen scope and word count. The AI status line also detects a saved key that cannot be decrypted on the current device (for example after a portable install is moved to another Windows account) and prompts the user to re-enter the key rather than reporting a generic authentication error. Longer-horizon autocomplete policy tuning and richer model-catalog management remain future work.
- **Project workspaces and Find in Folder.** Deferred to v1.2 (see 17.2).
- **Embedded media playback inside documents.** Out of scope for the editor.
- **PDF form filling and signing.** Out of scope.
- **Macro recording and playback.** Out of scope for v1.x.
- **Bundled font installation.** Quill uses system fonts only.
- **Telemetry by default.** Telemetry is and remains opt-in, off out of the box.
- **Anything that breaks DRM.** Quill will not include or escalate to tooling that removes DRM from any file, including KFX.

### 17.3 Confidence grades shown to the user

The Format Support settings page displays a grade per format:

- **Grade A**: bundled engine, high coverage, extensively tested. (All v1.0 in-box formats.)
- **Grade B**: bundled engine with known edge cases, or plugin with a stable upstream. Quality is good, occasional fallbacks expected.
- **Grade C**: plugin required to read at all, or the upstream format itself is unstable. Best-effort.

Grade is displayed prominently in the Open dialog when the user picks a file of a non-A format, with one line of context (“Kindle `.azw3` requires the Calibre Bridge plugin; current grade B with Calibre installed”) so expectations are set before the user hits Enter.

## 18. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Custom wx behaviour breaks a screen reader on a Windows update | Strict policy of stock controls; CI accessibility tests; rapid patch process |
| PDF extraction quality varies wildly | Layered extractors with scoring; manual escalation tiers; opt-in AI repair |
| AI provider API drift or pricing change | Provider-agnostic interface; user supplies key |
| Plugins introduce accessibility regressions | Manifest must declare UI surfaces; review checklist; plugins disabled by default |
| Custom spell engine underperforms TinySpell/Word | Layered architecture; Hunspell baseline; learning loop; published benchmarks |
| Keymap conflicts with screen-reader shortcuts | Explicit detection at capture time; refuse to capture conflicting chords with clear explanation |
| Localisation lags | Ship English first; community translation site; per-language readiness gates |
| Users expect bold and italic | Clear positioning; markdown supports inline emphasis textually; v1.x evaluation only after stable base |

## 19. Open questions

1. License: MIT for maximum adoption, or GPL to keep derivatives open. Leaning MIT.
2. Branding: Quill is a placeholder. Final name to be chosen with community input.
3. Should the contextual reranker be opt-in given memory cost?
4. JAWS scripts: ship a small one for live-region parity, or rely on `wx.Accessible` alone?
5. Hosting model for the community plugin registry.
6. Two-key chord sequences in default keymap: how many should we ship by default, given screen-reader users often prefer single chords?

---

## 20. Why this can be magical

The magic is not in any single feature. It is in the absence of friction:

- The window opens and the cursor is in the right place.
- Save just works. Save As appears exactly when it should.
- A PDF that was unreadable an hour ago becomes a clean searchable document with one keystroke.
- A bookmark you set last week still lands on the right paragraph after the document grew by three pages.
- The command palette knows the word you half remembered, and it tells you which key triggers it so you can learn the keystroke next time.
- If a keystroke does not suit you, you change it from the same palette without leaving the flow.
- Spell check is fast, local, and gets better the longer you use it. It never sends your writing anywhere.
- The screen reader never says anything you did not need to hear, and never goes quiet when you needed it to speak.
- When the power dies, the next launch returns your work.

Quill aims to feel like a very good fountain pen: simple in the hand, faithful on the page, and quietly delightful every time you reach for it.

### Document-intelligence implementation roadmap

This roadmap is the implementation order for the shared document-intelligence work now being folded into Quill.

1. **CSV Mode first.** Finish the accessible grid editor, the default-choice prompt, remembered CSV preference, and the ability to return to normal text editing at any time.
2. **Word support next.** Complete MarkItDown-first Word intake, semantic diagnostics, and review/fix hooks for `.docx` and legacy `.doc` flows.
3. **PowerPoint support next.** Finish slide linearisation, speaker-notes extraction, and reading-order diagnostics for `.pptx` and legacy `.ppt` flows.
4. **Then the rest of the document families.** Extend the same shared path to PDF refinement, EPUB/pages tuning, legacy Office fallbacks, version transparency, and provenance reporting.

The governing rules remain the same throughout the roadmap: local-first processing, no silent network calls, explicit consent for outbound content, and deterministic extraction before higher-level analysis.

### 21.14 Feature registry and profiles

- [x] Add a central feature registry module with metadata and dependency graphs.
- [x] Add layered feature-profile loading and merging.
- [x] Add shipped profile definitions for Essential, Casual Writer, Author or Student, Reader and Student, Office and Admin, Accessibility Professional, Developer and Power Text, Low Vision, Braille and Screen Reader Power User, and Full Quill.
- [x] Add a Profiles and Features settings page.
- [x] Add first-run profile selection onboarding.
- [x] Add command, menu, status-bar, settings, help, and format-handler feature ID gating.
- [x] Add dependency enforcement when enabling and disabling features.
- [x] Add profile import/export storage with schema validation.
- [x] Add locked safety rules that cannot be overridden by user profiles or imports.
- [x] Add feature metadata labels for risk, maturity, privacy, and network impact.
- [x] Add profile comparison preview in the Profiles and Features page.

### 21.15 Macro and compare expansion

- [x] Implement macro command capture across menu/shortcut/palette execution (excluding macro control commands and playback recursion).
- [x] Complete macro management UX and persistence polish for Start/Stop/Play/Manage workflows.
- [x] Expand interactive compare commands (next/previous/current/list/sync toggle/options) beyond diff-tab-only hunk navigation.
- [x] Add multi-document interactive compare support (3+ open docs) with structured announcements.
- [x] Add compare summary and copy/export actions (copy current/all differences, save markdown summary).
- [x] Audit transform/convert menu placement and command-ID consistency after Convert-menu migration.
- [x] Synchronize PRD checklist details with implemented macro and compare scope.
- [x] Run macro/compare regression suite and resolve resulting failures.

### 21.16 wx stability and hang resistance

- [x] Add a `quill.stability` package for logging, diagnostics, dispatch, heartbeat, task management, safe subprocesses, guarded regex, memory tracing, safe mode, and feature contracts.
- [x] Configure startup logging through a queue-backed listener so the wx main thread never blocks on file I/O.
- [x] Enable faulthandler at startup and keep a manual thread-stack dump path available from the CLI.
- [x] Add a `wx.Timer` heartbeat and watchdog that detect stalled UI loops.
- [x] Centralize worker-to-UI handoff through `wx.CallAfter`, custom wx events, and a coalesced progress reporter.
- [x] Route user-supplied regex through timeout-aware matching helpers.
- [x] Add a safe subprocess helper with explicit timeouts.
- [x] Add optional tracemalloc support and diagnostic bundle support for freeze reports.
- [x] Add a Safe Mode configuration path and startup flag handling.
- [x] Add feature contract validation for risky features.

### 21.17 Watch Profiles automation engine

- [x] Replace the legacy single-folder watcher with a multi-profile `quill.core.watch_service` facade (wx-free).
- [x] Add `watch_profiles`/`watch_profile_store` with schema-validated, independently enabled named profiles.
- [x] Add `watch_queue`/`watch_worker` so watch processing runs off the UI thread and marshals results through `wx.CallAfter`.
- [x] Add `watch_actions` for per-profile actions (open in editor, run intake action).
- [x] Add the accessible Watch Queue Monitor (queued/in-progress/completed/failed, with retry) under the Watch menu.
- [x] Surface watch status and failures through the existing status/notification channel; no silent failures.

### 21.18 Settings home and feature profiles UI

- [x] Add a registry-driven tabbed Settings dialog rendered from `quill.core.settings_registry`.
- [x] Add a settings search box (SET-6) that jumps to a matching control across pages.
- [x] Add Reset to Factory Defaults and profile Import paths that re-apply settings consistently (theme, spellcheck, wrap, tabs, menus).
- [x] Add feature-profile export/import (`.qpf`) with schema validation and locked-safety enforcement.

### 21.19 Update experience enhancements

- [x] Enhance the in-app update checker with manual Check for Updates, throttled background checks, and a skip-this-version option.
- [x] Add accessible streaming download progress announcements and a post-download Install/Open/Close dialog (reveal in folder, launch installer).
- [x] Record `skipped_update_version` and `last_update_check` in settings (documented in sections 5.74 and 10.12).

### 21.20 Foundation work in progress (post-1.0)

- [x] Wire the `quill.core.menu_customization` model into an accessible Menu Editor UI for **top-level** menus: reorder, rename, show/hide, and one Reset to Factory Defaults, opened from Edit > Customize Menus... (`app.menu_editor`). The build applies the saved customization through a post-build transform pass on the menu bar that bails out untouched if anything looks unexpected.
- [ ] Extend the Menu Editor to per-item reordering/hiding and editor context-menu entries (the `quill.core.menu_customization` model already supports both; the remaining work is the item-level UI and a stable item-key binding in the menu build).

### 21.21 AI chat, Prompt Library, and Quillin Manager (Phase 2/3)

- [x] Add `ask_ai` dialog with provider selection (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama), model list, and prompt field. Smart focus: prompt field when configured, provider choice when not. A11Y-4 hardened.
- [x] Add `check_grammar_with_ai()` command — sends selection or full document to AI; uses `ai_prompt_default_model` setting (falls back to `ai_chat_default_model`). Runs off UI thread.
- [x] Add AI Prompt Library (`quill/core/prompt_library.py`) with 12 built-in prompts, full CRUD, enable/disable, per-prompt optional shortcut, and `.pqp` import/export.
- [x] Add Prompt Library dialog (`quill/ui/prompt_library_dialog.py`) — searchable list, run with AI, new/edit/delete prompts, import/export `.pqp`.
- [x] Add `ai_prompt_default_model` setting in `Preferences > AI`.
- [x] Add bundled Quillin `ai-writing-prompts` with 7 prompts contributed to the Prompt Library at load time (no capability declaration needed; prompts.json sidecar pattern).
- [x] Add `install_extension()` to `quill/core/quillins/loader.py` with path-containment enforcement.
- [x] Add Install from Folder button to Quillin Manager; uses `wx.DirDialog` + `install_extension()`.
- [x] Add `.pqp` (Prompt Quill Pack) file format: `{"schema": "quill.prompt-pack/1", "name": "...", "prompts": [...]}`.
- [x] API keys stored exclusively in Windows Credential Manager (`quill-openrouter-api-key`, `quill-openai-api-key`, `quill-ollama-api-key`); never in `settings.json`.
- [x] Add `.sqp` (Skill Quill Pack) file format: `quill.skill/1` schema; YAML front matter + Markdown steps; parameters, condition branching, output blocks, use-prompt/use-skill delegation.
- [x] Add `quill/core/skill_pack.py`: parser, validator (`validate_skill`), synchronous runner (`run_skill`); no streaming by design.
- [x] Add `quill/tools/sqp_validator.py`: CLI validator with `--strict` mode.
- [x] Add bundled `ai-writing-skills` Quillin with 4 sample skills (Accessible Rewrite, Research and Draft, Meeting Notes to Action Items, Argument Strengthener).
- [x] Add `tests/unit/core/test_skill_pack.py`: 23 tests covering parsing, validation, runner, condition branching, depth limit, and all bundled files.
- [x] Add `quill/platform/windows/credential_store.py`: unified credential access with env-var, portable DPAPI file, and Credential Manager backends. Activated by portable-mode detection (filesystem evidence: `quill.exe` + `data/` at the bundle anchor). Update `ai_chat_dialog.py` and `assistant_ai.py` to use it.
- [x] Add bundled Quillin `math-equations` (`com.quill.bundled.math-equations`): `Insert → Insert Equation...` (`Ctrl+Shift+E`) inserts LaTeX or MathML at the caret. Two-step accessible dialog: (1) prompt for equation text with selection pre-fill and delimiter stripping; (2) display-mode choice (Inline `$...$` / Block `$$...$$`). MathML (`<math ...>`) detected automatically and inserted verbatim. `quill/core/browser_preview.py` and `quill/io/export.py` inject MathJax 3 CDN script tag so equations render in Browser Preview and HTML export. Sample equations in `docs/math/latex_testing.md`. 14 unit tests in `tests/unit/core/test_quillins_bundled_math_equations.py`. Original contribution by Robert Danaraj; redesigned as a sandboxed Quillin.

## §22. Startup Wizard — Personalise QUILL

### §22.1 Overview

The Startup Wizard is a first-run wizard that lets every user shape QUILL to their work and accessibility needs before the main frame appears. It is also re-runnable at any time via Help > Personalise QUILL. Features the user disables are completely hidden — no menus, no commands, no phantom shortcuts.

The wizard (`SetupWizardDialog` in `quill/ui/setup_wizard_pages.py`) is a single `wx.Dialog` hosting nine `wx.Panel` pages shown one at a time with Back / Next / Finish navigation. Choices are held in pending state and applied to `Settings`/`FeatureManager` atomically only when the user clicks Finish, so backing out changes nothing. Every page heading is a real control with an accessible name; focus on page change lands on the first interactive control.

### §22.2 The Nine Pages (as built)

1. **Welcome** — introductory text; no configuration.
2. **Keyboard and Sound** — keyboard pack and whether QUILL plays sounds for mode changes.
3. **Feature Profile** — choose Essential, Writer, Developer and Power Text, Accessibility Professional, or Full QUILL.
4. **Remote Access** — enable/disable the FTP / SFTP / WebDAV / S3 open and save features.
5. **AI Assistance** — enable/disable AI features (API key added later).
6. **Reading and Accessibility** — Read Aloud and the spoken-announcement verbosity (Minimal / Normal / Verbose).
7. **Writing Tools** — spell check as you type, word prediction and tag IntelliSense, and curly-quote autoformatting.
8. **Startup Behaviour** — start with no document open, check for updates on startup, and system tray icon.
9. **Summary** — review every decision; Finish applies them.

Planned wizard additions not yet present (tracked in `docs/planning.md`): an interface-language selector page, a watch-folder onboarding step, and dedicated Quillins / Power Tools / Notebook / keyboard-profile pages.

### §22.3 Feature Gating via FeatureManager

`quill/core/feature_flags.py` defines a frozen `FeatureFlags` dataclass and `is_enabled(flag: str) -> bool`. The wizard writes a `feature_flags` block into `settings.json` via `write_json_atomic`. `MainFrame.__init__` loads flags before building menus, the command registry, and keybindings.

The two network-capable gated features are:

- `core.remote` — SSH/SFTP remote editing. When disabled, the Remote menu and all SSH commands are absent.
- `future.ai` — AI writing assistance. When disabled, Ask Quill, Prompt Library, Skill Library, grammar check, and all AI commands are absent.

Commands with `feature_tag = None` are always present (core editing). Commands whose tag is disabled are excluded from the command palette search and their keyboard bindings are not registered, so `Ctrl+?` discovery shows no ghost shortcuts.

### §22.4 First-Run Detection and Re-run

`setup_wizard_completed` in `settings.json` (type bool, default False) controls first-run detection. When the field is absent or False, `MainFrame.__init__` runs `run_setup_wizard(parent=None)` before any UI is shown, then reloads settings before building menus.

Re-run opens the wizard in update mode with all pages pre-filled. Changed flags trigger `_apply_feature_flags()`, which rebuilds the affected menu groups, refreshes the command palette, re-applies the keymap profile, and announces the change — no restart required.

### §22.5 Settings Additions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup_wizard_completed` | bool | False | Suppresses wizard on next launch |
| `feature_flags_ai` | bool | True | Master switch for all AI features |
| `feature_flags_remote` | bool | True | Master switch for remote editing |
| `feature_flags_quillins` | bool | True | Master switch for Quillins |
| `import_export_recursive` | bool | True | Wizard default: include subfolders in batch conversion (`### 5.3a.1`) |
| `import_export_overwrite` | choice | `ask` | Wizard default: `ask`, `never`, or `always` |
| `import_export_output_layout` | choice | `subfolder` | Wizard default: `subfolder` or `same_folder` |
| `import_export_last_folder` | text | `""` | Wizard-only: remembered last folder; not exposed in Preferences |

The four `import_export_*` fields are documented in full at `### 5.3a.1.6`. They are written by the Startup Wizard when the chosen intent profile enables Pandoc import / export, and by the Batch Conversion wizard on every successful Start click.
| `feature_flags_power_tools` | bool | True | Master switch for Power Tools |
| `feature_flags_notebook` | bool | True | Master switch for Notebook workspace |
| `keymap_profile` | str | "default" | Active keyboard profile name |

### §22.6 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED.** Phases 1-3 complete: `setup_wizard.py`, `setup_wizard_pages.py`, `feature_flags.py`, `feature_registry.py`, and `check_feature_tags.py` CI gate are all in production. Phase 4 (additional keymap profiles beyond the shipped defaults) is in progress.

## §23. Context-Sensitive Help System

### §23.1 Overview

QUILL provides three help keystrokes that give the user immediate, contextual assistance without leaving the keyboard:

| Key | Command | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Help on This Control | Shows a small dialog describing the focused control |
| Ctrl+F1 | Open User Guide | Opens docs/html/USER_GUIDE.html in the system browser |
| Shift+F1 | What Can I Do Here? | Document-type context report (enhanced) |

`F1` always returns something useful. There are three fallback levels: (1) named schema topic via `ctrl.GetName()`, (2) generic description by `ctrl.GetClassName()`, (3) control name + tooltip + prompt to open the User Guide.

### §23.2 Architecture

```
quill/core/help/topics.json          schema: topic id, title, body, keystrokes, user_guide_section
quill/core/help/renderer.py          render_live(), render_doc(), generate_markdown()
quill/ui/context_help.py             ContextHelpDialog, ContextHelpMixin, describe_focused()
quill/tools/build_docs.py            generates docs/CONTROL_REFERENCE.md from topics.json
quill/tools/check_help_coverage.py   CI gate: stale entries fail; coverage gaps warn
```

Topic IDs are derived from `ctrl.GetName()`. Dialog controls are prefixed with the dialog's accessible name: `connect_to_ssh_server.host_or_ip_address`. This works because the dialog contract already requires every interactive control to carry a meaningful `SetName()`.

`ContextHelpMixin` is added to `MainFrame`'s MRO. It tracks the last-focused control via `EVT_CHILD_FOCUS` so that navigating to `Help > Help on This Control` via the menu bar still describes the correct control.

### §23.3 ContextHelpDialog Screen-Reader Design

The dialog contains a single read-only `wx.TextCtrl` (multi-line, no border, dialog background colour) with combined title and body text, plus a Close button. Using one TextCtrl means NVDA reads the dialog title then the entire content line by line on open, without the user tabbing between controls first. Focus lands on the TextCtrl. Closing the dialog restores focus to the described control.

The dialog is registered in `dialog_inventory.json`. `affirmative_id = wx.ID_CLOSE`. Escape also closes it.

### §23.4 Topics Coverage

The schema (`quill/core/help/topics.json`) currently contains 134 topics covering:

- Main editor surface, status bar, document tabs
- All major dialogs: Find/Replace, Spell Check, AI Assistant, Remote/SSH, Preferences pages
- Startup Wizard pages (F1 on any wizard control explains the effect of each choice)
- Feature profiles, keyboard packs, read-aloud settings
- All 25 braille commands registered in `quill/core/feature_command_map.py` (status, navigation, page tools, translation, back-translation, pack install, line/cell, progress, save-as-clean, line-ending normalize). A regression test in `tests/unit/tools/test_help_coverage.py` (`test_every_braille_command_has_a_help_topic`) walks the command map and fails CI if a new `braille.*` command ships without a topic.

Full coverage target is 250 topics (all `SetName()` calls in `quill/ui/`).

### §23.5 CI Gate

`quill/tools/check_help_coverage.py` enforces two rules:

- **Blocking:** A topic ID in `topics.json` has no matching `SetName()` call in `quill/ui/`. Stale entries describe UI that no longer exists.
- **Warning (non-blocking until `--strict`):** A `SetName()` call in `quill/ui/` has no matching topic. Coverage gap printed to stdout during the authoring sprint.

### §23.6 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED.** Phase A (infrastructure: `topics.json`, `renderer.py`, `context_help.py`, F1/Ctrl+F1/Shift+F1 wiring) complete. Phase B (schema authoring sprint, 109 of 250 topics complete) in progress. Phase D (coverage gate) complete. Phases C (documentation HTML build) and E (user guide restructure) in progress.

## §24. Translation and Community Localization

### §24.1 Overview

QUILL uses GNU gettext for all user-visible strings, with Babel for POT extraction and Crowdin for community translation management. The design follows the NV Access NVDA translation model, which has produced high-quality, screen-reader-tested translations across 50+ languages.

Speech announcement strings are first-class translation targets. They are marked with `#. SPEECH:` extracted comments in the POT file so translators can filter them for review and test them with a native screen reader in the target language.

### §24.2 Pipeline

```
quill/core/i18n.py          _(), ngettext(), lazy_gettext(), init_locale()
babel.cfg                   Babel extraction configuration
quill/locale/quill.pot      Master string template (auto-generated by pybabel extract)
quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po   Per-language translation (community, via Crowdin)
quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.mo   Compiled binary (generated by pybabel compile)
quill/tools/check_translation.py           CI gate
```

`init_locale()` is called in `MainFrame.__init__` before any UI string. The `language` setting (BCP 47 tag, default empty = OS locale) controls the active locale. A startup-wizard language selector (shown when more than one `.mo` file is present) is planned; the shipped wizard does not yet include it.

### §24.3 Crowdin Components

Three Crowdin components manage translation content:

1. **UI strings** — source `quill/locale/quill.pot`, target `quill/locale/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/quill.po`
2. **Context-sensitive help** — source `quill/core/help/topics.json`, target `quill/core/help/topics_{lang}.json`
3. **Quillin manifests** — source each bundled `manifest.json`, target `manifest_{lang}.json`

Auto-PR on approved translation; PRs land on `main` after the CI gate passes.

### §24.4 Four-Tier Role Model

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Translator | Suggests translations in Crowdin |
| Proofreader | Approves or rejects suggestions for their language |
| Language Coordinator | Manages proofreaders, owns language quality, reviews PRs |
| Translation Coordinator | Project-level; runs translation calls, onboards teams, resolves disputes |

The Translation Coordinator is a named maintainer role in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

### §24.5 Language Priority

- **Tier 1 (target: ship with QUILL 1.0):** French (fr), German (de), Spanish (es)
- **Tier 2 (close follow-on):** Portuguese/Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), Japanese (ja), Italian (it)
- **Tier 3 (RTL, requires layout work):** Arabic (ar), Hebrew (he)

Completeness thresholds: 90% for established languages, 70% for a language's first release. Languages below threshold are excluded from that release's language selector.

### §24.6 CI Gate

`quill/tools/check_translation.py` checks: POT currency (dry-run pybabel extract + diff), completeness threshold per language, mnemonic `&` preservation, placeholder `{n}` / `%(count)s` preservation, and no empty translated strings.

### §24.7 Implementation Status

**Phase 1 infrastructure complete:** `quill/core/i18n.py`, `babel.cfg`, `check_translation.py` gate, `language` setting, and `init_locale()` call are all in production. **Phase 2 (string marking sprint)** is in progress — sweeping all user-visible strings in `quill/ui/` and `quill/core/` to wrap them with `_()`. Pilot languages (fr, de, es) are pending community formation and a named Translation Coordinator.

## §25. GitHub Remote File Access

### §25.1 Overview

QUILL provides first-class GitHub repository browsing, remote file opening, and file commit-back through **File > Open from Remote > GitHub Repository...** This lets users open files from any public or private GitHub repository without requiring the GitHub CLI, GitHub Desktop, local Git, VS Code, or command-line interaction.

The implementation uses **PyGithub** behind QUILL's own `RemoteProvider` abstraction (`quill/core/github/provider.py`), which keeps the UI layer stable if the backend changes (e.g. direct REST, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### §25.2 Menu Structure

Added to the existing **File > Open from Remote** submenu:

```
File > Open from Remote
  ...FTP / SFTP / WebDAV / S3 items (existing)...
  ---
  GitHub Repository...
  GitHub File URL...
  Save to GitHub...
  GitHub Items...
  ---
  Manage Remote Sites...   (existing)
  Manage GitHub Accounts...
```

All five GitHub commands are also available through the Command Palette.

### §25.3 Feature Flag

Feature ID: `core.github_remote`  
Category: `core`  
Privacy: `network after confirmation`  
Dependencies: `core.remote`  
Optional dep: `pip install "quill[github]"` (installs PyGithub >= 2.0)

When the flag is off, all five GitHub menu items are absent. When PyGithub is not installed, QUILL shows a friendly message with the install command.

### §25.4 Authentication

**First-run consent.** The first time the user opens a GitHub feature, a one-time consent dialog explains that QUILL will connect to api.github.com for the user's chosen repositories. Consent is stored in `github_consent.json` in the user data directory.

**Anonymous access.** Public repositories are browsable without a token. Rate limits are lower (60 requests/hour vs 5,000 with auth).

**Personal Access Token.** The user pastes a token with at minimum `public_repo` scope (add `repo` for private repositories). The token is stored in **Windows Credential Manager** under the target name `quill-github-token` using DPAPI. Never stored in `settings.json` or any plaintext file.

**Token management.** File > Open from Remote > Manage GitHub Accounts... lets the user view the stored identity, add/replace the token, and sign out (deletes the stored token).

### §25.5 Repository Browser

A native `wx.Dialog` with:

- **Account label** (signed-in identity or "Anonymous").
- **Repository field** (`owner/repo` text entry) + **Load** button. Enter key also triggers Load.
- **Branch/tag choice** (populated after Load; defaults to the repository's default branch).
- **Current path label** (breadcrumb).
- **File list** (`wx.ListCtrl`, single-select, columns: Name / Type / Size). Directories appear first, sorted A-Z; files follow, sorted A-Z.
- **Status label** (loading state, error messages, item count).
- **Buttons**: Open File, Go Up, Refresh, Copy URL, Cancel.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- Enter on a folder: navigates into it.
- Enter on a file: same as Open File.
- Backspace: go up one level (when not at root).
- F5: refresh.

All controls have accessible names. Long operations (repository load, directory listing, file fetch) run on daemon threads; the dialog remains interactive during loading.

### §25.6 GitHub File URL

**File > Open from Remote > GitHub File URL...** accepts a pasted `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path` URL and opens the file directly without requiring the user to navigate the browser. Useful for sharing links.

### §25.7 Save to GitHub

**File > Open from Remote > Save to GitHub...** is available when the active document was opened from GitHub. QUILL prompts for a commit message, then commits the current document text to the same repository, branch, and path using the GitHub API (`update_file`). The file SHA is tracked for optimistic concurrency; if the file has changed remotely since it was opened, GitHub returns a 409 and QUILL shows a clear error.

Requirements: the stored token must have `repo` (write) scope on the target repository.

This command is intentionally not wired to the regular Save shortcut. The user must invoke it explicitly from the menu or Command Palette to avoid accidental commits.

### §25.8 Remote Origin Metadata

When a file is opened from GitHub, QUILL stores a `RemoteOrigin` dataclass keyed by the local temp path:

```python
RemoteOrigin(
    provider="github",
    account_id="github:login",
    repository="owner/repo",
    ref="main",
    path="docs/example.md",
    sha="abc123...",
    url="https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/docs/example.md",
    opened_at="2026-06-12T..."
)
```

The tab's `source_label` is set to `GitHub: owner/repo (branch)` and shown in the title bar.

### §25.9 Security Properties

- No network access until the user explicitly opens a GitHub feature and accepts the consent dialog.
- Tokens stored via DPAPI; never logged, never in diagnostic bundles.
- File size limit: 1 MB (GitHub API limit for the contents endpoint). Files exceeding this are rejected with a clear error.
- Save-back requires explicit user action and a commit message.
- No silent background syncing or polling.

### §25.10 Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `quill/core/github/__init__.py` | Package marker |
| `quill/core/github/models.py` | `RemoteAccount`, `RemoteRepository`, `RemoteRef`, `RemoteNode`, `RemoteFile`, `RemoteOrigin`, `BrowseResult` |

| `quill/ui/main_frame_github_items.py` | `GitHubItemsMixin` — Safe Mode + consent + token gate (#924) |

### §25.11 Implementation Status

**SHIPPED** (2026-06-12). All five implementation phases complete:
- Phase 1: Core service layer and models.
- Phase 2: Authentication (token + anonymous).
- Phase 3: Repository browser dialog.
- Phase 4: Remote document integration (origin metadata, title, save-back).
- Phase 5: Gate compliance (banned patterns, dialog inventory, module size budget, mypy overrides).


---

### §25.12 GitHub Items Viewer (read-only repository browser, #924)

**File > Open from Remote > GitHub Items...** opens a read-only, screen-reader-first
browser for a repository's issues, pull requests, branches, commits, tags,
releases, and workflow runs. It is modeled on the [GHManage](https://github.com/kellylford/GHManage)
reference viewer (the same field set, list modes, and per-comment navigation),
adapted to QUILL's PyGithub transport and dialog conventions. v1 is **read-only**;
mutating actions (close / reopen / comment) are out of scope.

**Views.** A single **View** switcher selects one of:

| View | Columns | Detail pane |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Issues & PRs | number, type, state, title, author, updated, labels, comments | full issue/PR body + comment thread |
| Branches | name, protected, author, date, commit | branch metadata; Enter drills into that branch's commits |
| Commits | short_sha, author, date, message | full sha, author, date, diff stats, message |
| Tags | name, commit_sha | tag + commit |
| Releases | tag, name, draft, prerelease, created | release name, flags, body (release notes) |
| Workflow Runs | name, status, conclusion, branch, event, run_number | run status + conclusion |

The **Issues & PRs** view is the combined inbox from GHManage: two PyGithub
calls (issues + pulls) merged and sorted in one place. It adds three filters the
other views do not need: **Show** (Both / Issues / PRs), **State** (Open /
Closed / All), and **Sort** (number, title, updated, comments — asc/desc).

**List mode (accessibility, GHManage parity).** **Quick** shows compact cells
exactly as they appear in the columns. **Full** spells each non-empty cell as
`col: value` (e.g. `number: 208, type: ISSUE, state: OPEN`) so a screen reader
reads a self-describing line per row instead of bare values with no field
names. Toggle with the **List mode** choice or `M` in the list.

**Detail pane + comment navigation.** Selecting an issue/PR shows the metadata
and body immediately, then fetches the comment thread off-thread and appends it.
**Alt+N** / **Alt+P** jump between comments, selecting and scrolling to each;
the navigator announces "Comment N of M" and "first/last" at the bounds.

**Repository field.** Prefilled from the active document's GitHub origin when
the document was opened from GitHub (`RemoteOrigin.repository`), so a user
editing a file from a repo can review that repo in one step. Otherwise the user
types `owner/repo` and clicks Load.

**Keyboard shortcuts.**

- `Enter` on a row: open the item in the browser; on a **Branch** row, drill
  into that branch's commits (switches the view to Commits scoped to it).
- `Ctrl+R`: refresh the current view.
- `Ctrl+O`: open the selected item in the browser.
- `Ctrl+G`: go to an issue/PR by number (Issues & PRs view only).
- `Alt+N` / `Alt+P`: next / previous comment in the details pane.
- `M` (in the list): toggle Quick / Full list mode.
- **View More**: load the next page (page cap = page * 30).

**Threading and accessibility.** All fetches (list load, comment thread) run on
daemon threads and update the UI via `wx.CallAfter` (`# GATE-40-OK`); the UI
thread never blocks on the network. Every control has a `SetName`; the status
label announces load state, counts, and the keyboard map. The dialog is shown
through `show_modal_dialog` + `apply_modal_ids` (never `ShowModal`).

**Gates (same as every GitHub entry point).**

- **Safe Mode** refuses before any network or consent work
  (`refuse_in_safe_mode` -> `GitHubItemsError` `QUILL-GITHUB-ITEMS-ERROR`).
- **Consent + PyGithub availability** via the shared `_ensure_github_ready`
  (first-run consent dialog; friendly message + install hint when PyGithub is
  absent).
- **Token** from the OS credential store (`quill-github-token`); the provider
  is constructed in the mixin and handed to the dialog so the dialog never
  touches secrets or consent. Anonymous (tokenless) access works for public
  repositories at the lower rate limit.

**Feature flag.** `core.github_remote` (off by default) gates the command via
`feature_command_map` (`file.open_github_items`). When off, the menu item is
absent.

**Error mapping.** 404 -> "not found", 401 -> "invalid or expired token",
403 -> "Access denied (check the token's `repo` scope)"; all surfaced as
`GitHubItemsError(CodedError)` with the `QUILL-GITHUB-ITEMS-ERROR` code so they
are greppable and never crash the dialog.

## §26. Braille Mode (BRF/BRL/PEF/UEB)

Braille Mode makes QUILL a first-class proofreading environment for formatted
braille text files. The full plan lives in `docs/planning/planning.md` under
"Feature: Braille Mode"; this section captures the shipped requirements. The
detailed engine design and the liblouis deployment/packaging plan are also in
that planning section.

### Requirements

- **Open (BR-004).** `.brf`, `.brl`, `.pef`, and `.ueb` are recognised as a
  braille-text family and read as NABCC (braille ASCII): a UTF-8 BOM is stripped,
  non-braille-ASCII characters are recorded (not transformed), and line-ending
  and form-feed shape is detected. The pure model lives in `quill/core/brf_*`
  (document, ascii guard, page map) and `quill/core/braille_position.py`.
- **Save byte-for-byte (BR-012).** Saving a braille file performs no line-ending
  normalization, no trailing-space trimming, and preserves form feeds and
  encoding, so open→save is byte-identical. A single soft, non-blocking warning
  is surfaced when non-NABCC characters are written; the characters are saved
  as-is (falling back to UTF-8) so a unicode-braille codepoint never crashes the
  save.
- **Status bar (BR-010).** While a braille document is active the status bar
  carries a braille cell — `BRF Pg p/P | Ln l/L | Cell c/C | Print n` — rebuilt
  from a cached `BraillePositionResolver` and refreshed on caret movement. The
  print-page segment is filled in by the Phase 2 print-page detector
  (BR-013) when one is available, or reads `Print ?` when the detector
  cannot locate a print-page anchor for the caret page.
- **Commands and menu (BR-011).** A top-level **Braille** menu groups Status,
  Navigation, and Page Tools commands. Default bindings are intentionally unset
  so nothing collides with screen-reader or editor shortcuts; commands are
  reachable from the menu, the Command Palette, and any user-assigned key. Every
  command degrades to a spoken "not a braille document" on non-braille files.
- **Print-page and running-head detection (BR-013).** `quill/core/brf_page_detection.py`
  is a pure module that walks the page map once and emits a confidence-labelled
  print-page indicator per detected boundary (`high`, `medium`, or `low`).
  * High confidence: a print-page-change separator line
    (`---------#ab` / `---------#12a` / `---------#1`) is the canonical anchor;
    a right-margin number on line 1 that matches the previous detected page
    and carries a continuation letter is also high. * Medium: a right-aligned
    number on line 1 with no other anchor; a consistent sequence across
    several pages. * Low: an ambiguous right-margin number; a short page with
    multiple candidates. The detector also produces a `BraillePageMarker` per
    page (the right-margin number on the last line) and a `RunningHead` per
    page (the leading text of line 1).
- **Detailed status and print-page navigation (BR-014).** Six new commands
  wire the detector into the editor surface:
  * `Go to Print Page…` opens a `wx.TextEntryDialog` for a print-page number,
    snaps the caret to the start of the braille page that hosts it, and
    announces the new braille page and print page.
  * `Next Print Page Change` / `Previous Print Page Change` step the caret
    to the next / previous print-page boundary in the detector output.
  * `Announce Running Head` reads the running head of the caret page aloud
    (or "No running head detected for this page." when the line-1 text is
    empty or absent).
  * `Include Running Head in Status` / `Omit Running Head from Status` set
    the `braille_include_running_head` setting.
  `read_detailed_braille_status` now composes the full example string from
  the spec — print page, continuation letter, running head, proofing state,
  and detection confidence — pulling live data from the new detector.
  `read_current_print_page` no longer hard-codes "Print page unknown"; it
  announces the most recent detected print page at or before the caret.
- **Translation, optional and out-of-process (BR-020/021/022).** Forward and
  back UEB translation require the optional **Braille Pack** (liblouis + UEB
  tables). 
  
  The pack implements a three-layer architecture:
  1. **Table Inventory (Catalog)**: A machine-readable JSON catalog (`tables_catalog.json`) of every table file in the pack, including metadata (language, type, grade) extracted from table headers.
  2. **User Profiles**: A mapping (`brf_profiles.json`) of friendly names to specific translation and display tables, categorized by role (Recommended, Legacy, etc.) and status.
  3. **Verified Runtime**: Each profile is smoke-tested against golden BRF samples using `lou_translate.exe` to ensure validity before being marked as 'available'.
  
  liblouis is **never** imported in-process: each translation runs a
  short-lived worker subprocess via `stability.safe_subprocess`, killed on
  timeout and respawned on the next call, so a liblouis crash or hang cannot take
  QUILL down. The Translation submenu is shown only when the pack is detected and
  QUILL is not in Safe Mode; otherwise it is hidden (never disabled). Back-
  translation output is always labelled a *draft*. On worker failure QUILL
  announces the reason and opens no empty document.

- **Layout diagnostics and repair (BR-024, NLS-BRT parity).** A **Braille →
  Repair** submenu brings the NLS Braille Repair Tool's proofreading workflow to
  QUILL for the two classic problems: *page width exceeded* (a line over the cell
  limit, almost always trailing spaces) and *page depth exceeded* (a page over
  the line limit).
  - **Read Layout Metrics** (`braille.read_layout_metrics`) speaks the NLS-style
    status in one pass: cursor cell and current line length; the longest line in
    the file vs. the cells-per-line limit (with a "page width exceeded" warning);
    current/total braille pages and the line within the page; and the longest
    page vs. the lines-per-page limit (with a "page depth exceeded" warning).
  - **Go to Longest Line** / **Go to Longest Page**
    (`braille.go_to_longest_line`, `braille.go_to_longest_page`) move the caret to
    the worst offender for manual repair, recording the jump in the location ring.
  - **Remove Trailing Spaces on This Line** / **…in Whole File**
    (`braille.strip_trailing_spaces_line`, `braille.strip_trailing_spaces_document`)
    strip trailing spaces/tabs while preserving every line ending and form feed.
  - The cell and line limits come from the existing `braille_cells_per_line`
    (28–42, default 40) and `braille_lines_per_page` (20–30, default 25)
    settings, so the diagnostics honour the user's configured page geometry.
  - **Implementation map.** `quill/core/brf_repair.py` (pure: `LayoutMetrics`,
    `compute_layout_metrics`, `describe_layout`, `longest_line_offset`,
    `longest_page_offset`, `strip_trailing_spaces_all`,
    `strip_trailing_spaces_current_line`), `quill/ui/main_frame_braille_repair.py`
    (`BrailleRepairMixin`, in its own module so the at-budget
    `main_frame_braille.py` need not grow), `quill/core/feature_command_map.py`,
    `quill/core/help/topics.json`. Tests: `tests/unit/core/test_brf_repair.py`.

### Non-goals (this phase)

The proofing/sidecar workflow (Phase 3) and the bundled translation
pack install path remain tracked separately (BR-015 and later). The translation
install path is a no-op stub until the signed, audited download lands; see the
deployment plan in `docs/planning/planning.md` (Feature: Braille Mode).
Six-key entry and an embedded forward-translation editor (as in NLS-BRT's
"contracted braille typed manually") remain out of scope.

## §27. Markdown Profiles and Table of Contents (#257)

### §27.1 Overview

A community PRD (issue #257, "Support for Markdown_py-style extensions such
as nl2br and toc") asked for plain-language Markdown profiles and a
deterministic table of contents. Before this work, QUILL's only
table-of-contents generator was the **AI Generate Table of Contents** agent
task (`assistant_agents.py`, `agent_id="toc"`) — useful, but it requires a
configured AI provider, a network round trip, and produces a result that is
only as faithful as the model's read of the document. A screen-reader user
with AI disabled, working offline, or who simply wants a result guaranteed to
match the heading text exactly had no alternative.

§27 ships the non-AI alternative and the friendly-naming layer the PRD asked
for, as Phase 1 of that PRD's four-phase rollout (the PRD's own §23
"Implementation Phases"). Phases 2-4 (a full Extension Customization dialog,
EPUB-ready export, and a curated third-party extension ecosystem) remain
backlog.

### §27.2 What shipped

- **`quill/core/markdown_extensions.py`** (pure, no `wx`): `extract_headings`
  parses ATX (`#`) headings with the same slug algorithm Browser Preview uses
  for heading anchors, so a generated table of contents always links to the
  same IDs the preview renders. `generate_toc` builds a nested Markdown
  bullet list of links; `insert_toc` either replaces a `[TOC]` marker or
  inserts after the first heading. `check_heading_structure` is the Phase 1
  slice of the PRD's accessibility checker (missing H1, skipped heading
  levels, empty headings). `apply_nl2br` is the `nl2br` extension —
  paragraph-aware line-break preservation for poetry, lyrics, and transcripts.
- **`quill/core/markdown_profiles.py`** (pure): a friendly-name catalog
  (`MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS`) mapping technical names (`toc`, `nl2br`, `tables`,
  `fenced_code`, `footnotes`, `task_lists`, `strikethrough`, `def_list`) to
  plain-language names and descriptions (PRD principle 7.2), and eight
  built-in profiles (PRD principle 7.3 / §10): Standard Markdown,
  GitHub-Style Markdown, Documentation, Poetry and Lyrics, Accessible
  Publishing, Technical Writing, PRD and Release Notes, and Custom.
  `describe_profile` renders the screen-reader-friendly status line from
  PRD §13.1/§13.4 (*"Markdown profile: Documentation. 5 extensions enabled.
  ..."*).
- **Commands** (Format > Markdown, plus Insert): Insert Table of Contents,
  Select Markdown Profile, Preserve Single Line Breaks, Read Markdown
  Processing Status, Select Citation Style. Wired through the same
  declarative `main_frame_power_tools_menu.py` contribution grammar as every
  other power-tool command.
- **Feature tag:** `core.markdown_profiles` (category `"markdown"`). This is
  the point of the exercise as much as the TOC generator itself: the feature
  catalog previously had no way to say "this is a deterministic text feature"
  versus "this calls a model." `core.markdown_profiles` and `future.ai` are
  now siblings under `FEATURE_DEFINITIONS`, not the same bucket — disabling
  AI (Safe Mode, or any profile with `future.ai` off) never disables Insert
  Table of Contents.
- **Persona profile:** a new **Author or Student** `FeatureProfile`
  (`quill/core/features.py`) turns `core.markdown_profiles` on by default,
  alongside the existing citation tooling (§ below, `core.citations`/
  `quill/core/citations.py`, issue #203) and a configurable citation style
  (Markdown footnotes, the default, or full MLA/Chicago/APA bibliography
  entries via the citation module already shipped in 0.5.1 — no new
  dependency either way). See §27.4.

### §27.3 What already existed and was not duplicated

Tables, fenced code blocks, footnotes, and task lists are already rendered by
`quill.core.browser_preview` and already have Insert commands
(`format.insert_table`, `format.insert_code_block`, `format.insert_footnote`,
`format.insert_task_list`). §27 catalogs them as named extensions (so a user
can ask "what does the Documentation profile turn on?" and get a real
answer) without re-implementing a parser QUILL already has.

### §27.4 Persona profiles (Casual Writer, Author or Student)

While closing #257, the **Writer** persona profile was renamed **Casual
Writer** (id unchanged — `"writer"` — so saved settings and the onboarding
wizard's `technical_profile="writer"` mapping are unaffected) to make room
for a more precise sibling: **Author or Student**, a new ninth persona
profile for long-form writing with a table of contents, footnotes, and
citations — papers, theses, and class assignments. It turns on
`core.markdown_profiles` and `core.text_encoding` (§28) by default and keeps
`core.macros` / `future.regex_library` quiet or off, since that audience
wants structure and citations, not regex tooling. See §5.1g's shipped-profile
list for the full nine-persona-plus-Full-Quill catalog.

### §27.5 Non-goals (this phase)

A dedicated Extension Customization dialog (PRD §13.2), per-document
extension overrides, EPUB export, and curated third-party extensions are
PRD §257 Phases 2-4 and are not part of this drop. The eight profiles are
catalog data today (used for `describe_profile` and for gating which
extensions a persona profile favors); a future phase wires per-profile
extension toggles into preview/export rendering directly.

## §28. HTML Entity Conversion and Minimum Required Encoding (#256)

### §28.1 Overview

A community PRD (issue #256, "Feature: Convert from HTML entities to
characters") asked for two things: decode HTML entities (`&eacute;` → `é`)
and then save the result in the smallest encoding that can represent it
losslessly, rather than forcing UTF-8. Most of the surrounding machinery
already existed from issue #197 (`quill/core/encoding_tools.py`: find
non-ASCII characters, encode them to entities, re-encode to a chosen
charset) and from the EDS-21 text-transform wave
(`quill/core/format_ops.py::decode_html_entities`, already wired as
**Format > HTML & Encoding > Decode HTML Entities**). §256's actual gap was
narrow: nothing picked the *minimum* encoding automatically.

### §28.2 What shipped

- **`quill/core/encoding_tools.py`** gained `can_encode`, `minimum_encoding`
  (tries ASCII → Latin-1 → Windows-1252 → UTF-8 in order, per PRD §9.8, and
  always succeeds because UTF-8 is the guaranteed fallback), and
  `describe_minimum_encoding` (the screen-reader summary from PRD §9.12: *"Current
  encoding: ISO-8859-1. Minimum required encoding after recent edits:
  Windows-1252."*).
- **Commands** (Format > HTML & Encoding): Analyze Encoding Requirements
  (opens a read-only report, mirroring the existing Show Non-ASCII
  Characters command) and Save Using Minimum Required Encoding (computes the
  minimum codec and saves a copy with it, mirroring the existing Re-encode
  As flow but without an extra encoding-choice prompt).
- **Feature tag:** `core.text_encoding` (category `"text"`). The pre-existing
  `power.*` entity/encoding commands (`strip_html_tags`,
  `decode_html_entities`, `encode_html_entities`, `encode_all_non_ascii`,
  `show_non_ascii`, `reencode_file`, the non-ASCII jump pair) were re-tagged
  onto this feature too, instead of the generic always-on fallback they had
  before — the same "give it a real, non-AI category" treatment as §27.
- **Text-utility gap fill:** while auditing encoding-adjacent commands for
  parity with the established EDS-21/22 text-transform waves, three small
  gaps were closed: `remove_email_quote_markers` (strip `>` / `Name>` quote
  prefixes), `strip_low_ascii` / `strip_high_ascii` (control-character and
  non-ASCII stripping), and `hex_dump` (classic offset/hex/ASCII dump for
  inspecting a selection's raw bytes).

### §28.3 Non-goals (this phase)

A live preview/details dialog before conversion (PRD §9.4/§9.5), a per-`nbsp`
handling preference, and an "Always warn before changing file encoding"
preference toggle are PRD §256 Phases 2-4. `decode_html_entities` already
satisfies the "never silently destroy unknown entities" requirement for
free: `html.unescape` leaves unrecognized named entities untouched.

## §29. Emmet-Style Abbreviation Expansion (MVP)

### §29.1 Overview

A community proposal asked for deep Emmet-compatible abbreviation support:
type a compact shorthand such as `ul>li.item$*3>a[href]{Item $}` and expand
it into full markup, with the full Emmet operator grammar, CSS shorthand,
and accessibility-aware boilerplate snippets. The full proposal scoped a
multi-phase product (placeholder/tab-stop navigation after expansion, a
snippet manager, suggestions, Quillin extension points, a Markdown
abbreviation pack, per-language mappings). This release ships the MVP: a
real, tested expansion engine and three commands, with the rest tracked as
backlog below rather than half-built.

### §29.2 What shipped

- **`quill/core/emmet.py`** (pure, no `wx`): a recursive-descent parser for
  the core Emmet grammar — child (`>`), sibling (`+`), climb-up (`^`),
  grouping (`()`), multiplication (`*N`), numbering (`$`, `$$`, ... with
  zero-padding), ids (`#id`), classes (`.a.b`), attributes
  (`[attr="value" bool-attr]`), and text content (`{...}`). Numbering
  resolves against the *nearest enclosing* multiplier, so
  `ul>li*3>span.label$` numbers the span 1-3 by its enclosing `li`, not a
  fixed `1`, matching real Emmet's nested-repetition behavior.
- **Implicit tags and attributes**: a segment with no explicit tag name
  defaults sensibly by parent context (`ul>.item` → `ul>li.item`,
  `table>tr>td` already implicit for `tr`'s children), and common tags pick
  up helpful default attributes when none are given (`a` → `href=""`,
  `img` → `src="" alt=""`, `input` → `type="text"`).
  Void elements (`br`, `img`, `input`, `hr`, ...) render without a closing
  tag or content.
  HTML5 boilerplate and accessibility snippets are matched as exact
  abbreviation strings before grammar parsing: `!` (HTML5 skeleton),
  `!a11y` (HTML5 with a skip link and `header`/`main`/`footer` landmarks),
  `skiplink`, `form:a11y` (fieldset/legend, label linked to its input via
  `for`/`id`), and `table:a11y` (caption, `<th scope="col">` header row).
- **A curated CSS abbreviation subset**: bare shorthand for common
  declarations (`d:f` → `display: flex;`, `pos:a` → `position: absolute;`,
  and ~30 more), plus numeric box-model shorthand (`m10` → `margin: 10px;`,
  `m10-20` → `margin: 10px 20px;`, `mt-10` → `margin-top: -10px;`). This is
  a curated common subset, not Emmet's full fuzzy CSS matcher.
- **Three commands** (Edit menu): **Expand Abbreviation** replaces the
  current selection — or, with no selection, the non-whitespace token
  immediately before the cursor — with its expansion in place (one atomic
  edit, so Undo reverts the whole expansion in a single step, consistent
  with every other power-tool transform). **Preview Abbreviation...**
  prompts for an abbreviation (pre-filled from the selection, if any) and
  opens the expansion in a new buffer without touching the current
  document. **Explain Abbreviation...** opens a plain-text, indented
  description of the parsed tree (tag, id, classes, attribute names,
  repetition count) for reviewing what an abbreviation *means* before
  committing to it — useful for learning the grammar non-visually.
- **Mode detection**: when the active document's file extension is `.css`,
  all three commands treat the input as a CSS abbreviation instead of HTML.
- **Feature tag**: `core.emmet` (category `"markup"`), depending on
  `core.editor`. A syntax error in the typed abbreviation reports a clear
  status-bar message (e.g. *"Could not expand abbreviation: Expected ']' at
  position 4..."*) rather than raising or silently doing nothing.

### §29.3 Non-goals (this phase — Phase 2/3 backlog)

- **Placeholder/tab-stop navigation** after expansion (jump between empty
  attribute values and text slots the way snippet engines do).
- **A snippet manager** for user-defined custom abbreviations/snippets.
- **Quillin extension points** (an `ExpansionProvider` interface so
  third-party Quillins can contribute abbreviation packs or override
  expansion for a language).
- **Markdown-specific abbreviations** (a Markdown abbreviation pack distinct
  from the HTML grammar).
- **Numbering modifiers** `@-` (reverse) and `@N` (custom start) — only
  ascending numbering from 1 is supported.
- **Chaining children directly after a multiplied group**
  (e.g. `(a+b)*2>c`) — rejected with a clear error rather than silently
  guessing intent.
- **A full fuzzy CSS abbreviation engine** — only the curated subset in
  §29.2 is implemented; unrecognized CSS abbreviations return `None` rather
  than guessing.
- **Live suggestions/autocomplete** while typing an abbreviation (Tab-trigger
  style) — expansion is explicit, command-driven.

## §30. Branding, legal, and trademark policy (0.7.0+)

### §30.1 Public product name

The product ships under the public name **"QUILL for All"**. The legacy short
name "Quill" remains valid as a programmer-friendly identifier (package name,
`__init__` symbol, command-line tool name) but is no longer presented to end
users in product surfaces.

All product-facing strings — window titles, About dialog, support info,
installer metadata, README, release notes, GitHub release titles — read
`QUILL for All`. The single source of truth is `quill/branding.py`:

- `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` = `"QUILL for All"`
- `APP_FULL_NAME` = `"QUILL for All — A screen-reader-first writing environment"`
- `APP_ORGANIZATION` = `"Community Access"`
- `APP_DESCRIPTION` — short tagline used in installer metadata and README
- `APP_COPYRIGHT` — copyright line displayed in About and README
- `APP_LICENSE_NAME` — license name displayed in About and LICENSE
- `APP_SHORT_NAME` = `"Quill"` — programmer-friendly identifier
- `INDEPENDENCE_NOTICE` — explicit statement of independence from any
  assistive-technology vendor

### §30.2 Independence notice

`INDEPENDENCE_NOTICE` is surfaced in:

- The **About** dialog Legal tab
- `about_info.support_info()` (the Copy Support Info payload)
- The README Legal section
- The Notice file at the repository root

The notice states that QUILL for All is developed independently of any
assistive-technology vendor and that vendor and screen-reader names appear for
compatibility purposes only. This is non-negotiable.

### §30.3 Trademark and legal documentation

The repository ships four canonical legal documents. Their content is governed
by a CI check that asserts each file contains the required notice strings.

| File | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LICENSE` | All | Full license text (project license) |
| `NOTICE` | All | Attribution notices and the independence statement |
| `TRADEMARKS.md` | End users, contributors | Trademark acknowledgements and usage rules |
| `docs/legal/legal-notices.md` | Embedded in About | Short, accessible summary shown in the Legal tab |
| `docs/legal/trademark-notices.md` | Detailed reference | Full vendor acknowledgements with links |

The `tests/unit/tools/test_legal_docs.py` gate ensures:

1. The independence notice appears verbatim in each surface it is required in.
2. `TRADEMARKS.md` lists every third-party trademark referenced in the
   About dialog Dependencies tab.
3. The product name "QUILL for All" appears consistently across all five
   files.

### §30.4 Module policy

- No `quill/core`, `quill/io`, or `quill/platform` module may hard-code the
  string `"QUILL for All"` or `"Community Access"` directly. Use
  `quill.branding` constants instead.
- `quill/ui` modules may reference the constants; literal string duplication
  is discouraged but tolerated where templating would obscure intent.
- New translations of the About dialog or support info payload must be
  derived from the branding constants, not from copies of the strings.

---

## §31. Build-number system and single source of truth (0.7.0+)

### §31.1 The drift problem

Prior to 0.7.0, the version string lived in `quill/__init__.py` (`__version__`)
and was copied — by hand — into `installer/quill.iss`, the CHANGELOG, the
autoupdate manifest, README, and the GitHub release title. Each of those
copies was a drift hazard: a version bump in the codebase could leave
installer metadata, the update feed, and the docs all out of sync.

### §31.2 `build/version.toml` — the canonical source

The single source of truth is `build/version.toml`:

```toml
[build]
base_version = "0.7.0"
channel = "beta"           # dev | alpha | beta | rc | stable
prerelease_number = 1
product_name = "QUILL for All"
publisher = "Community Access"
website = "https://community-access.github.io/quill/"
```

The display version is derived as:

- `stable` → `base_version` (e.g. `0.7.0`)
- `alpha` → `{base_version} Alpha {prerelease_number}` (e.g. `0.7.0 Alpha 1`)
- `beta` → `{base_version} Beta {prerelease_number}` (e.g. `0.7.0 Beta 1`)
- `rc` → `{base_version} Release Candidate {prerelease_number}` (e.g. `0.7.0
  Release Candidate 1`)

### §31.3 Generated artefacts

`tools/generate_build_info.py` reads `build/version.toml` and emits two
artefacts:

1. **`quill/_build_info.py`** — a small Python module of frozen constants
   (`BUILD_BASE_VERSION`, `BUILD_CHANNEL`, `BUILD_PRERELEASE_NUMBER`,
   `BUILD_PRODUCT_NAME`, `BUILD_PUBLISHER`, `BUILD_WEBSITE`,
   `BUILD_DISPLAY_VERSION`, `BUILD_PEP440_VERSION`, `BUILD_IS_RELEASE_BUILD`).
   This file is regenerated at packaging time and is the authoritative source
   read by the About dialog, support info, crash reports, and InnoSetup.
2. **`build/build-info.txt`** — a plain-text summary used by InnoSetup's
   pre-build step to substitute `AppName`, `AppPublisher`, `AppVersion`, and
   `OutputBaseFilename`.

### §31.4 Safe read wrapper

`quill/build_info.py` is a safe read wrapper around `quill/_build_info.py`.
When the generated module is present it re-exports its constants. When it is
absent (e.g. during a fresh clone before packaging) it falls back to safe
dev-build defaults derived from `quill/__version__`:

- `get_display_version()` — `"0.7.0 Beta 1"` form
- `get_short_version()` — `"0.7.0"` form
- `get_support_info()` — formatted text payload for the Copy Support Info
  button
- `is_release_build()` — `True` only when channel is `stable`

`quill/__init__.py` re-exports both modules and the public helpers so that
`from quill import build_info` and `from quill import APP_DISPLAY_NAME` work
without further imports.

### §31.5 The version consistency gate (GATE-VC)

`quill/tools/check_version_consistency.py` is a CI gate. It asserts:

- `pyproject.toml` uses `dynamic = ["version"]` and `[tool.hatch.version]
  path = "quill/__init__.py"`.
- `installer/quill.iss` `#define AppVersion` and `OutputBaseFilename` both
  match the canonical version.
- `CHANGELOG.md` top version heading matches.
- All five checks pass together.

The gate is run from `scripts/verify_release_corpus.py` and is included in
`windows-release.yml`.

### §31.6 The release procedure for version changes

To bump the version:

1. Edit `build/version.toml`.
2. Run `python -m tools.generate_build_info` to refresh the generated
   artefacts.
3. Add a `## <new version>` heading to `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Run `pytest -q` and `python -m quill.tools.check_version_consistency`.
5. Commit, push, tag.

No other file (installer script, About dialog, manifest generator) needs
editing — they all read from the canonical source.

---

## §32. About dialog (0.7.0+)

The About dialog is a 4-tab `wx.Notebook`:

1. **Overview** — product name, version, copyright, short description.
2. **Legal** — license name, independence notice, and short legal summary
   (mirrors `docs/legal/legal-notices.md`).
3. **Dependencies** — list of third-party packages, license, and version
   (mirrors the Dependencies section of TRADEMARKS.md).
4. **Links** — website, source, issue tracker, support.

Title is dynamic: `f"About {about_info.product_name}"`.

The dialog also exposes a **Copy Support Info** button that copies
`about_info.support_info()` (a single multi-line string containing product
name, version, install path, build identity, and platform info) to the
clipboard for inclusion in support emails and bug reports.

`quill/core/about_info.py` is the single source of truth for every field
the dialog renders. The dialog does no string formatting of its own.

---

## §33. Autoupdate manifest contract (0.7.0+)

The autoupdate manifest at
`docs/site/updates/.quill-update-feed-v1.json` is published by the
`windows-release.yml` workflow on every tagged release. The manifest
schema:

```json
{
  "version": "0.7.0 Beta 2",
  "download_url": "https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/releases/download/v0.7.0-beta2/Quill-for-All-Setup-0.7.0 Beta 2.exe",
  "published_at": "2026-06-19T12:34:56Z",
  "notes": "Release notes excerpt.",
  "signature": "<HMAC-SHA256>"
}
```

### §33.1 Invariants

1. `manifest.version` matches the **display version** of the release
   (e.g. `0.7.0 Beta 2`), not the PEP 440 form. The display form is what
   `quill/build_info.get_display_version()` returns and what the running
   build uses for version comparison.
2. `manifest.download_url` matches the **actual installer filename** the
   InnoSetup script produces (`Quill-for-All-Setup-<display_version>.exe`).
   A rename in the installer script without updating the manifest is a
   gate failure.
3. `manifest.signature` is HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical JSON form of the
   payload, signed with the deployment key in `QUILL_UPDATE_MANIFEST_KEY`.
   The running build rejects manifests whose signature does not verify.

### §33.2 Version comparison

The running build compares its own display version against the manifest
version using `quill.core.updates._version_tuple()`, which accepts both the
display form (`0.7.0 Beta 1`) and the PEP 440 form (`0.7.0-beta1`) and
orders them consistently:

- A final (non-pre-release) build outranks every pre-release of the same
  `major.minor.patch`.
- Within pre-releases, RC > beta > alpha.
- Pre-release digit ordering is monotonic (`beta1 < beta2 < beta3`).

A 0.7.0 beta 1 build sees beta 2 as newer. A 0.7.0 stable build sees beta 1
as older (so users on stable are not nagged about pre-releases).

### §33.3 Publisher contract

`scripts/generate_update_feed.py` is the only producer of the manifest. It
reads `build/version.toml` for the version, reads the installer filename
from `installer/quill.iss` for the download URL, and signs the payload.
The `windows-release.yml` workflow runs it on every tagged release and
commits the resulting JSON back to `docs/site/updates/`.

# Thread-safety invariants

This note documents the concurrency invariants for Quill's module-level and
shared caches (CQ-17). It is the canonical reference for how the lazily-loaded
caches stay correct when several threads touch them at once — the writing thread,
the file-I/O and compute pools, and watch-folder worker threads.

## Concurrency model recap

- The UI thread owns the wxPython widgets and the editor buffer.
- File I/O and heavier compute run on worker threads / thread pools.
- Cross-thread UI updates marshal back through `wx.CallAfter` / `wx.CallLater`.

Because a lazily-loaded cache can be touched from more than one of these threads
on first use, each such cache is guarded by a lock. There are no unguarded
module-level mutable caches in `quill/core`.

## Pattern 1 — module-level lazy caches (double-checked locking)

Read-mostly data that is expensive to build once and then never changes uses a
module-level `threading.Lock` plus double-checked locking: an unlocked fast-path
read of the cached value, then the lock, a re-check, and population under the
lock. The cached value is always an immutable snapshot (a `frozenset`, or a dict
that is never mutated after publication), so readers that win the fast path never
observe a half-built structure.

| Cache | Module | Lock | Cached state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Word-list fallback | [quill/core/spellcheck.py](../../quill/core/spellcheck.py) | `_BACKEND_LOCK` | `_WORDLIST_CACHE` (`frozenset`) |
| Enchant dictionary handle | [quill/core/spellcheck.py](../../quill/core/spellcheck.py) | `_BACKEND_LOCK` | `_ENCHANT_DICT`, `_ENCHANT_TRIED` |
| Thesaurus index | [quill/core/thesaurus.py](../../quill/core/thesaurus.py) | `_LOAD_LOCK` | `_INDEX` (dict, never mutated after build), `_LOAD_ERROR` |

Invariants for this pattern:

1. The cache slot is only ever written while holding the lock.
2. Once published, the cached object is treated as immutable. To refresh it,
   replace the whole slot under the lock; never mutate in place.
3. The fast-path read outside the lock is safe because it reads a single
   reference that is either `None` (not yet built) or a fully-built snapshot.
4. A failed load still publishes a definitive result (an empty cache plus an
   error string) so the expensive attempt is not retried on every call.

## Pattern 2 — per-instance mutable-set caches

Caches that are genuinely mutated over time hold a per-instance
`threading.Lock` and take it around every read and write of the shared mutable
state.

| Cache | Module | Lock | Shared state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Watch-folder seen-set | [quill/core/watch_folder.py](../../quill/core/watch_folder.py) | `self._lock` | `self._seen_files` (`set[str]`) |

Invariants for this pattern:

1. Every access to the mutable set — `clear`, membership test, and `add` — is
   performed inside `with self._lock`.
2. The lock is held only for the brief set operation, never across slow work
   such as file I/O or dispatching an action, so worker threads do not serialise
   behind each other.

## Stability helpers

The stability layer follows the same per-instance discipline: the task manager
([quill/stability/task_manager.py](../../quill/stability/task_manager.py)), the
wx dispatch queue ([quill/stability/wx_dispatch.py](../../quill/stability/wx_dispatch.py)),
and the heartbeat ([quill/stability/wx_heartbeat.py](../../quill/stability/wx_heartbeat.py))
each own a `threading.Lock` and take it around their shared bookkeeping.

## Rule for new caches

Any new module-level or shared cache must adopt one of the two patterns above:
a double-checked `Lock` with an immutable published snapshot for read-mostly
data, or a per-instance `Lock` taken around every access for mutable state. Do
not add an unguarded module-level mutable cache to `quill/core`.

# Docs-artifact regeneration pipeline

This note documents how Quill keeps each `docs/**/*.md` source in sync with its
rendered `.html` and `.epub` artifacts, and how the GitHub Actions workflows that
enforce and automate that stay correct. It is the canonical reference for the
[Docs artifacts](../../.github/workflows/docs-artifacts.yml) workflow, the
docs-parity guard ([scripts/check_docs_artifacts.py](../../scripts/check_docs_artifacts.py)),
and the `workflow-lint` gate in [PR CI](../../.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml).

## What the pipeline guarantees

Every Markdown file under `docs/` ships alongside a matching HTML and EPUB build,
so readers who consume the published artifacts never see a stale rendering of a
source that has since changed. Two mechanisms cooperate:

- A **parity guard** that fails CI when an edited `docs/**/*.md` is missing an
  updated `.html` or `.epub` sibling in the same change.
- An **auto-regeneration workflow** that rebuilds artifacts for changed sources
  and, on a same-repo pull request, pushes them back to the PR branch so the
  author does not have to install Pandoc.

## The parity guard

[scripts/check_docs_artifacts.py](../../scripts/check_docs_artifacts.py) diffs a
base and head ref, and for every changed `docs/**/*.md` source that still exists,
requires that both its `.html` and `.epub` siblings also changed in that range.
It recurses into subdirectories (`docs/planning`, `docs/qa`, ...), not just the
top level. The guard runs as the "Verify docs artifacts are regenerated" step in
[Accessibility CI](../../.github/workflows/accessibility-ci.yml) and is a
required check.

## The auto-regeneration workflow

[Docs artifacts](../../.github/workflows/docs-artifacts.yml) triggers only when a
`docs/**.md` source changes. It has two design constraints that drove its
current shape, both learned from real failures.

### Constraint 1 — EPUB output is non-deterministic

Pandoc embeds a fresh UUID and build timestamp in every EPUB, so regenerating an
unchanged source produces different bytes each run. HTML output, by contrast, is
deterministic. A naive "regenerate everything and commit the diff" approach
therefore reports false staleness on every run and fails forever.

The workflow handles this by:

1. Scoping regeneration to only the Markdown that changed in the push/PR range
   (mirroring the parity guard), not the whole tree.
2. Always rebuilding the **deterministic HTML**, but generating an EPUB **only
   when it is missing** — never rewriting an existing one, so the random-UUID
   churn cannot manifest.
3. Basing the "is this stale?" decision on deterministic HTML drift plus
   genuinely untracked new files, never on EPUB byte differences.

### Constraint 2 — `main` is a protected branch

The workflow cannot push regenerated artifacts to `main`: branch protection
requires changes to arrive through a pull request, so a direct push is rejected
(`GH006: Protected branch update failed`). Attempting it was the original chronic
failure. The reconcile step now branches on context:

- **Same-repo pull request:** commit the regenerated artifacts and push them back
  to the PR's source branch, so the eventual merge into `main` is already in sync.
- **Push to `main`, or a fork PR:** do not attempt a push. Fail loudly with the
  exact diff and a "regenerate locally" message, so a human regenerates the
  artifacts and brings them in through a pull request.

### Regenerating locally

When the workflow or the parity guard reports a stale artifact, regenerate it
with the same Pandoc invocations CI uses:

```bash
pandoc <source>.md -f gfm -t html5 -s -o <source>.html
pandoc <source>.md -f gfm -t epub3      -o <source>.epub
```

Commit both artifacts with the source (through a pull request for `main`).

## Workflow linting (`workflow-lint`)

The `workflow-lint` job in [PR CI](../../.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml) runs
[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) (pinned to a specific image)
over every workflow on each push and pull request. It statically validates YAML
structure, action input contracts, and shell-safety patterns.

This gate exists because a real script-injection vector slipped into the docs
workflow: an untrusted `${{ github.head_ref }}` was interpolated directly into an
inline `git push` script, where a crafted branch name could execute arbitrary
shell. The fix — and the rule the gate now enforces automatically — is to pass
workflow context through the step `env:` block and reference it as a shell
variable, never to expand untrusted `${{ github.* }}` values inline.

## Verifying the workflow logic

Because the reconcile logic is shell rather than Python, it is validated two ways:

1. **Static analysis** with actionlint, now wired into CI as `workflow-lint`.
2. **Behavioral simulation** against a throwaway git repository with a bare remote
   whose `pre-receive` hook rejects writes to `main` (simulating branch
   protection) and a mock `pandoc` that mirrors the measured behavior
   (deterministic HTML, random-bytes EPUB). The simulation exercises the
   in-sync, fail-loud, recursive-subdirectory, missing-EPUB, no-churn, and
   PR-push-back paths.

When changing the reconcile logic, re-run actionlint locally and re-run the
behavioral simulation before relying on CI.

The macOS build reuses the cross-platform wxPython core plus the
`quill/platform/macos/` adapters. See issue #42 for the full plan.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon or Intel), Python 3.11+
- `pip install -e ".[ui,macos]"` (wxPython, comtypes on Windows, pyobjc, py2app)
- For distribution: an Apple **Developer ID Application** certificate and a
  `notarytool` keychain profile (`xcrun notarytool store-credentials`).

## Build

```bash
python scripts/setup_macos.py py2app   # -> dist/Quill.app
```

## Sign, notarize, package

```bash
export IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export NOTARY_PROFILE="quill-notary"
./scripts/build_macos.sh              # -> dist/Quill.dmg (signed, notarized, stapled)
```

## Platform adapters (macOS)

- App entry point: `quill/platform/macos/macos_app.py` (py2app bundle main)
- Screen reader detect: `quill/platform/macos/sr_detect.py` (VoiceOver)
- Increase Contrast: `quill/platform/macos/high_contrast.py`
- Secrets: `quill/platform/macos/keychain.py` (Keychain, replaces DPAPI)
- Announcements: `quill/platform/macos/announce.py` (VoiceOver via NSAccessibility; needs pyobjc)
- File types: `quill/platform/macos/shell_integration.py` (CFBundleDocumentTypes)
- OS dispatch: `quill/platform/dispatch.py`

## Remaining integration (tracked in #42)

- Route the app's announce handler to `macos.announce.announce` on macOS (ties to #29).
- Migrate secret/high-contrast/screen-reader call sites to `quill.platform.dispatch`.
- Verify the app launches under VoiceOver; keyboard-only QA.

## macOS platform review (2026-07-09)

A full-codebase audit of QUILL's macOS support landed a batch of fixes that close the highest-traffic macOS gaps without rebinding the still-unvalidated bare-F-key chords. The live backlog of remaining work is tracked in `docs/planning/macos-review-backlog.md`. Completed this pass:

- **Earcon volume on macOS.** `_NSSoundBackend` now applies `NSSound.setVolume_()` per active sound; the volume slider is no longer a no-op.
- **Read Aloud speaks on macOS.** Live WAV playback now uses `afplay` on macOS (via a cross-platform `_LiveWavPlayer`) instead of falling through a `winsound`-only guard and silently deleting every synthesized WAV.
- **VoiceOver announcements hardened.** `macos/announce.py` adds a main-thread guard (marshals off-main calls onto the main queue via libdispatch), a 4096-char payload cap with ellipsis truncation, and `interrupt=True/False` mapped to NSAccessibility priority high/low (matching `prism_bridge` `force_speech` semantics).
- **macOS keymap chords.** Find Next/Previous (`Cmd+G`/`Cmd+Shift+G`), Replace (`Cmd+Alt+F`), Pop Mark (`Cmd+Alt+M`), and Select Chunk (`Cmd+Alt+Space`) now have darwin alternates that avoid collisions with Hide/Minimize/Spotlight. Provisional pending real-Mac validation (same caveat as the doc-switch chord).
- **Atomic document writes.** `write_text_atomic` (temp + `fsync` + `os.replace`, mirroring `write_json_atomic`) now backs `autosave_document`, `write_text_document`, and `_write_brf_document`, so a crash mid-save can no longer corrupt the user's document or the recovery snapshot.
- **Mac conventions.** The redundant `Cmd+F4` close-document accelerator and the Help-menu "About Quill" entry are hidden on macOS (the Application menu shows it via `wx.ID_ABOUT`); `Cmd+W` already closes documents.
- **Cross-platform messaging.** The dictation "microphone unavailable" message and the "Dictation (offline speech)" component description now branch for macOS instead of citing Windows-only SAPI 5 / permission paths; `total_ram_gb()` reads real RAM via `sysctl` on macOS.
- **Packaging and tests.** The `[macos]` extra's `py2app`/`setuptools<83` deps carry `sys_platform == 'darwin'` markers; a `test` job in `macos-release.yml` runs `pytest -m "not slow"` on `macos-26`; dependency tests assert macOS packaging deps are darwin-marked and Windows-only deps never appear in the `[macos]` extra; `test_high_contrast.py` now tests true/false/missing-CLI behavior rather than a bare `isinstance(bool)`.
- **macOS low-hanging-fruit pass (2026-07-09).** Five no-Mac-hardware-safe fixes from the platform review backlog: (1) tray minimize/restore status messages now say "menu bar" on macOS instead of "system tray" (the surface renders as a menu-bar status item there), via a module-level `_TRAY_NOUN` constant read once at import and applied at six `_set_status` call sites; (2) the Settings default-folder hint shows a `/Users/...` example on macOS instead of a Windows `C:\Users\...` path (the only `C:\Users` hint in the tree); (3) the AI Hub Engines tab's install-complete callback (`_after_install`) now guards all four post-install widget calls against a destroyed-panel `RuntimeError`, not just the Set Up button re-enable, so closing the Hub before a background pack install finishes is a clean no-op rather than a crash on whichever widget happened to tear down last; (4) bundled-tool relative paths (`external_tools.bundled_subpath`) use forward slashes so the bundled binary is actually found on macOS, where a backslash is a literal filename character rather than a separator; (5) the zero-caller Windows HTML/RTF email-clipboard module is flagged as dead code with a note that a revival needs a macOS `NSPasteboard` counterpart (it degrades to plain text on macOS today). #11, #12, #55, and #59 are closed; #37 is partially closed (the path-hint instance, with a broader "dialog terminology" sweep remaining); #38 and #51 are deferred pending real Mac hardware; #40's premise was false and is closed (the `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+` chords and `Alt+Shift+D` are actively routed to the AI/compare command class and `view.toggle_dark_mode` respectively).
- **macOS review batch 2 (2026-07-09).** Five more fixes from the platform review backlog, worked lowest-to-highest priority, all verifiable on this Windows dev box via unit tests: (1) **#46 closed** — MathCAT is no longer offered as a download on macOS; like DECtalk, its only backend is a Windows `.dll` (`libmathcat_c.dll`) that can never load on a Mac, so the optional-component catalog now gates it Windows-only inside the existing `if sys.platform.startswith("win"):` block alongside DECtalk (a pure platform-branch relocation; no new public surface). (2) **#60/#73 closed** — the macOS `security` CLI takes a keychain secret as `-w <secret>` in separate argv elements, and a short or non-hex secret slipped past `redact_command_arg`'s token regexes into the diagnostics log; `format_args_for_log` now redacts the value that follows `-w` explicitly before the generic per-arg pass, so a key passed to Keychain can never appear in a submitted report. Three fixes are code-complete and unit-tested here but only show their real effect on real macOS hardware, so they're closed *pending tester validation* (reopenable via Help > Report a Bug if a symptom persists): (3) **#38** — `persona_launcher.write_launch_shortcut` now writes a Finder-launchable `.command` shell script (`#!/bin/sh` + `exec` + `os.chmod 0o755`) on darwin instead of a useless Windows `.bat` (Finder runs `.command` files in Terminal, unlike `.sh`, which opens in a text editor); (4) **#51** — the Simple File Open dialog's "toggle hidden files" chord is now `Cmd+Shift+.` on macOS (the Finder convention) instead of `Ctrl+H` (which is macOS's system Hide-window shortcut and would hide QUILL), via a small platform-aware `_toggle_hidden_key_pressed` helper shared by the path-field and list key handlers; (5) **#64/#77** — `synthesize_with_espeak` pipes very long input (over 8,000 characters) to eSpeak via `--stdin` instead of passing it as a trailing argv element that can overflow the OS command-line length (Windows ~32,767) and truncate or abort a very long Read Aloud span with no clear error. The live backlog is `docs/planning/review.md`, which now carries the three tester-pending items in a dedicated reopenable section.
- **macOS review batch 3a (2026-07-09).** Six more fixes from the platform review backlog, all code-complete and unit-tested on this Windows dev box (no Mac hardware required for the code or the tests): (1) **#47 closed** — the braille pack download is now gated Windows-only via a new `braille_pack.braille_install_supported()` (mirroring the espeak/piper/pandoc/node/tesseract `*_install_supported()` gates); on macOS `download_braille_pack` shows a "Windows-only, install liblouis with Homebrew (`brew install liblouis`); QUILL will detect it automatically" message instead of attempting to fetch the pinned `lou_translate.exe` (a Windows binary that can never run on a Mac). `is_braille_pack_installed()` already detects a Homebrew liblouis via PATH/module lookup, so no download is needed there. (2) **#48 closed** — `external_engine._resolve_which` now consults macOS well-known dirs (`/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`) and, for Node, the highest version under `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`, because a Finder-launched `.app` gets a minimal PATH that never sources the user's login shell profile — so a real Homebrew/nvm install was on disk yet invisible to the engine allowlist. (3) **#41 closed** — the three LibreOffice conversion call sites (`_read_spreadsheet_via_libreoffice`, `_read_legacy_office_via_libreoffice` in `quill/io/structured.py`, and `_read_pages_via_libreoffice` in `quill/io/pages.py`) now resolve `soffice` via a new `external_tools.libreoffice_executable()` that finds `/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice` (where a standard macOS install puts it, never on PATH) instead of the bare `"soffice"` argv that missed every standard Mac; a missing install raises an ImportError with a `brew install --cask libreoffice`/libreoffice.org hint. (4) **#35 closed** — portable mode no longer silently drops credentials on macOS; with no DPAPI-equivalent single-folder store off Windows, a portable Mac build now routes load/save/delete to the login Keychain (the best available store) via extracted `_macos_keychain_*` helpers and logs a warning that Keychain storage is system-level, not portable, instead of losing the key with no signal. The non-portable macOS path was already Keychain-backed (#160) and now shares the same helpers. (5) **#7 closed** — the two drift-prone platform-dispatch mechanisms are consolidated: `quill.platform.dispatch`'s `is_high_contrast_enabled`/`detect_screen_reader` now delegate to the module-level-gated root helpers (`quill.platform.high_contrast`, `quill.platform.sr_detect`) instead of carrying their own copy of the platform branch, so a future macOS-routing change applied in one place is picked up everywhere. (6) **#50 closed** — the macOS `shell_integration` module (`launcher_command`, `document_types_plist`, `build_shell_integration_plan`, the best-effort `duti` association path, and its off-darwin/missing-duti no-op branches) now has direct test coverage in `tests/unit/platform/macos/test_shell_integration.py`. Deferred this batch (still open in `docs/planning/review.md`): #10 (relocate the platform-neutral `sr_announce`/`announce_engine` out of `windows/` — a pure refactor with many import sites and no behavioral change, deferred for a dedicated churn-controlled pass) and #13 (add an optional `platform` field to the dialog-inventory/egress-audit scan schemas — a broad snapshot-reshape, deferred separately).
- **macOS review batch 3b (2026-07-09).** Seven more fixes from the platform review backlog, all code-complete and unit-tested on this Windows dev box (no Mac hardware required for the code or the tests); #2 (native macOS TTS backend — the single biggest lever, which also closes #62/#75 and gives a self-voicing fallback) is deferred to batch 3c as a focused build. Four are fully fixed here: (1) **#58 closed** — `extract_pdf_text` no longer collapses every PDF read failure into "this looks like a scanned PDF — use OCR"; it now classifies four distinct cases with their own engine tags and remedies: *encrypted* (password-protected; suggests `qpdf --decrypt`), *damaged* (a real parse failure; suggests `qpdf --check` and notes OCR won't help a corrupt file), *scanned/image-only* (genuinely points at OCR), and *unavailable* (no extractor installed; points at Help > Download Optional Components). A new `_is_encrypted_pdf` reads `pypdf`'s `is_encrypted` and probes the empty user password, so a permissions-only lock (empty password opens it) is not misreported as encrypted. (2) **#4 closed** — keymap packs are no longer applied verbatim on macOS; `build_keymap_for_pack` now routes darwin pack overrides through `_apply_darwin_pack_overrides`, which folds Ctrl->Cmd for *comparison only* (wx maps ACCEL_CTRL to Cmd at runtime, so a pack's stored "Ctrl+G" and DEFAULT_KEYMAP's darwin "Cmd+G" are the same runtime shortcut even though they compare as different strings), drops any override whose runtime chord is macOS-system-reserved (Cmd+H/M/Q/W/Space/Tab/Grave, F9-F12, and the Alt+letter deadkeys), and drops any override that collides with another command's runtime chord — so no pack silently steals a system shortcut or a sibling binding. Storage is unchanged; only the comparison folds. (3) **#5 closed** — the screen-capture off-Windows message now names the macOS Screen Recording permission (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording) and the built-in Cmd+Shift+3/4/5 shortcuts as the in-the-meantime path, instead of the bare "only available on Windows." (4) **#8 closed** — `install_shell_integration` now returns a `ShellIntegrationStatus` (installed, message) dataclass hosted in the platform-neutral `quill/platform/shell_integration.py`, so the caller reports *why* nothing happened on macOS when `duti` (a third-party Homebrew tool, not preinstalled) is missing — a clear "install it with `brew install duti`; the app bundle's Info.plist associations still apply" message — instead of a false success. Three are code-complete and unit-tested here but only show their real effect on real macOS hardware, so they're closed *pending tester validation* (reopenable via Help > Report a Bug if a symptom persists): (5) **#6** — `quill/platform/macos/high_contrast.py` now also reads Dark Mode (`defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle`) and Reduce Motion (`defaults read com.apple.universalaccess reduceMotion`) alongside the existing Increase Contrast query, exposed via `is_dark_mode_enabled`/`is_reduce_motion_enabled`/`macos_appearance()` and re-exported through the neutral `quill/platform/high_contrast.py`; (6) **#29** — the STT self-test (`verify_component`) now synthesizes its test clip via the built-in macOS `say` command on darwin (and SAPI 5 on Windows) via `_synthesize_test_clip`/`_synthesize_test_clip_with_say`, so the speak->transcribe confidence loop can run on a Mac without a SAPI dependency; (7) **#65/#78** — pausing Read Aloud mid-sentence now keeps the cursor at the sentence start (re-reads the partial sentence on resume) instead of advancing to `span.end` as if the whole sentence had been spoken, for both the live eSpeak runner and the WAV-sentence runner, via an `interrupted = stop_event.is_set() or pause_event.is_set()` guard that chooses `span.start` vs `span.end`. Also **#40 closed (premise false)** — the `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+` chords and `Alt+Shift+D` are actively routed (to the AI/compare command class and `view.toggle_dark_mode` respectively), not dead. The live backlog is `docs/planning/review.md`.
- **macOS review batch 3c (2026-07-10).** Six more fixes from the platform review backlog, all code-complete and unit-tested on this Windows dev box (no Mac hardware required for the code or the tests); the full first-class Read Aloud macOS engine (#21/#75) is deferred for Mac-hardware validation. Four are fully fixed here: (1) **#1/#16/#43 closed** — `quill/platform/macos/keychain.py` now talks to Keychain through the native Security framework (pyobjc) first — `SecItemAdd`/`SecItemCopyMatching`/`SecItemUpdate`/`SecItemDelete`, with the secret passed only in the Keychain item's `kSecValueData` field where it never becomes a process argument — instead of the `security` CLI that takes the value as `-w <secret>` argv (visible to other processes and to the diagnostics log). The leaky CLI fallback still exists for machines without pyobjc, but `_warn_cli_secret_leak` warns the first time it's used that the secret will touch the command line. The no-argv-leak guarantee is pinned by cross-platform branching unit tests (`tests/unit/platform/macos/test_keychain_branching.py`: SecItemAdd used with no `subprocess.run`, secret in `kSecValueData`, duplicate->SecItemUpdate, missing->None, CLI fallback warns once, `_sec_call` normalizes both the (out,status) and bare-int return conventions). (2) **#74 closed** — `install_shell_integration` now refreshes LaunchServices after registering associations: `_app_path` walks up from the running executable (`Path(sys.executable).resolve()` and parents) to find the enclosing `.app` (recognizing a bundle from a Finder/Dock launch, not only when launched from inside one), and `refresh_launch_services(app_path)` force-registers the bundle with `lsregister -f` so the new default takes effect immediately instead of leaving the LaunchServices database stale until a reboot; gated off-darwin / missing-bundle / missing-tool. (3) **#76 closed (pending tester validation)** — `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py` now calls `menu_bar.SetWindowMenu(window_menu)` on darwin (guarded like the existing `SetHelpMenu` hint) so AppKit treats the Window menu as the system Window menu, moves it to its conventional slot just left of Help, and merges in the standard Minimize (Cmd+M)/Zoom/Bring-All-to-Front items and the live window list alongside QUILL's own Next/Previous/Close-Other/Send-to-Tray entries. (4) **#2 closed (self-voicing fallback)** — a new `quill/platform/macos/tts.py` native TTS backend exposes `available()`/`list_voices()` (an `NSSpeechSynthesizer.availableVoices()` + `attributesForVoice_()` catalog of `MacosVoice(id,name,language)`) and `speak_announcement(text,*,voice,rate)`/`stop_announcement()` (a main-thread-affined `NSSpeechSynthesizer` singleton, `startSpeakingString_`), all with lazy function-local pyobjc imports that degrade to `False`/`[]`/no-op off-mac. The darwin announce branch in `prism_bridge.py` (`AnnouncementEngine.announce`) now routes via a cached `_macos_screen_reader_active()` (30s TTL, probes `quill.platform.macos.sr_detect.detect_screen_reader`): to VoiceOver when a screen reader is running (unchanged, never self-voices over it), and to the native `macos_tts.speak_announcement` when none is — mirroring the Windows SAPI self-voice fallback so a low-vision Mac user without VoiceOver hears "Saved"/"Ln 12, Col 7"/the QUILL-key chord instead of silence, with state `active_backend="speech"`/`backend_name="System Speech"`. The routing is pinned by cross-platform branching tests (`tests/unit/platform/test_announce_voiceover.py`: both darwin branches exercised deterministically via a `_macos_screen_reader_active` monkeypatch; VoiceOver-off path reaches `speak_announcement` and never VoiceOver; VoiceOver-on path never builds the SAPI voice; both swallow errors) plus darwin-gated live tests (`tests/unit/platform/macos/test_tts.py`: `available()`/`list_voices()` assert on macOS CI; off-mac branching asserts everywhere). **Deferred (still open in `docs/planning/review.md`): #21/#75** — wiring "macOS (system voice)" as a first-class Read Aloud *engine* in Speech Hub (settings choices, voice picker, preview, export-to-file across the ~6 dispatch sites, including `NSSpeechSynthesizer`-to-WAV file synthesis). The native TTS backend that powers the self-voicing fallback is in place, but the full engine UX is deferred rather than shipped half-wired; the `read_aloud_engine` settings choices list still shows the Windows-era options on macOS for now. The live backlog is `docs/planning/review.md`.

# QUILL Dialog Estate Report (DLG-3)

_Last updated: 2026-06-04_

This report is the human-readable companion to the machine-enforced dialog
governance described in **PRD §9.13 (Dialog estate governance)** and tracked in
`docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` as DLG-3.0 through DLG-3.8. It records where the dialog-unification
work stands after the triage and Phase 3 hardening pass.

## Headline

- **154** dialog surfaces inventoried across `quill/**/*.py`.
- Classification: **100 native**, **49 hardened_custom**, **5 web**.
- Triage of all 49 `hardened_custom` surfaces: **0 convert / 48 harden / 1 keep-web**.
- **All 49** `hardened_custom` dialogs now wire the shared `dialog_contract`
  (`apply_modal_ids` + an accessible show path), enforced by a new AST guard.

## How the estate is governed

| Mechanism | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source-generated inventory | `quill/tools/dialog_inventory.py` | AST-scans every `wx.Dialog(...)`, stock wx dialog, and `show_web_form(...)`; assigns a stable key `<module>::<enclosing_qualname>::<kind>` and a sanctioned classification. |
| Committed snapshot | `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json` | The source of truth; CI fails if the live scan disagrees. |
| Inventory gate | `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py` | Fails on any new, moved, removed, or reclassified surface. |
| Banned-pattern gate | `quill/tools/check_banned_patterns.py` | Cross-checks every surface against the snapshot; fails on unregistered/misclassified dialogs (Security CI). |
| Shared contract helpers | `quill/ui/dialog_contract.py` | `apply_modal_ids(...)` (affirmative/escape IDs) and `show_modal_dialog(...)` (region + announcement hooks). |
| **Hardening guard (new)** | `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_hardening_contract.py` | AST-asserts every `hardened_custom` surface wires `apply_modal_ids` + an accessible show/`ShowModal`/`Show` path. Blocks future drift at author time. |

## Triage outcome

A live audit on the Windows wx 4.2.5 (Phoenix, wxWidgets 3.2.9) runtime, plus a
source scan for custom-drawn paint code
(`EVT_PAINT` / `wx.lib.agw` / `OnPaint` / `wx.PaintDC` / owner-draw / `wx.html2`),
returned **zero** custom-drawn dialogs. Every `hardened_custom` surface is already
a stock-widget `wx.Dialog` container (ListBox, TextCtrl, SearchCtrl, TreeCtrl,
multi-action button rows). "Convert to native" is therefore, in the literal wx
sense, already true — the genuine work is **contract hardening**, not rewrites.

| Bucket | Count | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convert (flatten to a stock one-shot) | **0** | No dialog is a lossless single confirm/choice/text entry; flattening any would drop live search, lists, previews, or multi-action rows. |
| Harden (enhanced-native onto one contract) | **48** | Genuinely multi-control native dialogs that converge on one focus/default/lifecycle grammar via `dialog_contract`. |
| Keep web | **1** | `AskQuillChatDialog` (rich streaming chat surface) stays on the sanctioned web surface. |

## Phase status

| Phase | Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Source-generated registry + gates | **Done** | Inventory engine + snapshot + two gates shipped. |
| 1 | Strengthened A11Y-4 dialog-contract guard | **Done** | `_check_dialog_registry` + Dialog Excellence Mandates. |
| T | Triage all 49 `hardened_custom` dialogs | **Done** | 0 convert / 48 harden / 1 keep-web. |
| 2 | Native conversion wave (flatten to one-shot) | **Done (no applicable work)** | Triage found zero lossless conversion candidates; honest no-op. |
| 3 | Enhanced-native contract standardization | **Done** | All 49 wire the shared contract; new AST guard prevents drift. |
| 4 | Web-surface standardization | **Todo** | Confirm the 5 web surfaces have native-fallback parity and no raw HTML in onboarding tabs. |
| 5 | Startup/onboarding hardening | **Todo** | Deterministic focus across chained startup modals; consent preserved. |
| 6 | Assistant/AI dialog consolidation (folds DLG-2) | **Todo** | `assistant_tools.py`/`ai_model_panel.py`/`train_style_dialog.py`/`assistant_panel.py` async/"busy" semantics. |
| 7 | CQ-16 characterization around dialog-launch paths | **Todo** | Return-value/side-effect regression tests before any CQ-1 split. |
| 8 | Manual NVDA/JAWS/Narrator SR pass | **Todo** | Requires a live Windows screen-reader runtime; cannot be machine-verified. |

## Phase 3 — what changed

A machine-derived AST audit of every `hardened_custom` scope found **5** surfaces
that did not fully wire the shared contract. Four were brought onto it; the fifth
was already correct.

| Dialog | Module | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_present_quill_key_help` | `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | Added `apply_modal_ids(ID_OK, ID_OK)`; routed direct `ShowModal()` through `_show_modal_dialog` (adds region/announce hooks). |
| `_offer_crash_recovery` | `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | Added `apply_modal_ids(ID_YES, ID_NO)` alongside existing `SetDefaultItem`/`SetEscapeId`. |
| `_present_quick_nav` | `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | Added `apply_modal_ids(ID_OK, ID_CANCEL)`; routed direct `ShowModal()` through `_show_modal_dialog`. |
| `_choose_searchable_option` | `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | Added `apply_modal_ids(ID_OK, ID_CANCEL)` + deterministic `search.SetFocus()`. |
| `show_watch_folder_status` | `quill/ui/main_frame.py` | No change — correctly-hardened **modeless** monitor (`Show()` + `EVT_CLOSE` → `Destroy`); the contract audit's "missing show" was a false positive for modeless windows. |

No dialog was flattened; live search, lists, and preview panes are preserved.

## Tests and validation

- `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_hardening_contract.py` — new durable guard (2 tests).
- `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_contract.py`, `test_dialog_inventory.py` — green.
- `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_navigation.py`, `test_main_frame_quill_key.py`,
  `test_main_frame_share_dialogs.py` — 113 passed (exercise the edited methods).
- `ruff format` + `ruff check` — clean.
- Banned-pattern gate — no violations.
- Dialog inventory — unchanged at 154 surfaces (100/49/5); no reclassification.

## Honest remaining work

- **Phases 4–7** are real engineering still to do (web parity, startup focus
  chains, assistant/AI async semantics, CQ-16 characterization).
- **Phase 8** is a manual NVDA/JAWS/Narrator pass that **cannot** be
  machine-verified; it needs a human tester on a live Windows screen-reader
  runtime, with each `dialogs.md` row carrying pass/fail evidence.

# Windows installer evaluation and rethink

This document evaluates the QUILL Windows installer (Inno Setup), grounded in
what QUILL actually ships, and records the changes made plus a forward-looking
vision. The `.iss` is generated by `build_inno_setup_script()` in
`scripts/build_windows_distribution.py`; edit the generator, never the emitted
`installer/quill.iss` (a test enforces they stay in sync).

## What QUILL actually installs

From `scripts/build_windows_distribution.py` and the portable bundle layout:

- A private embedded Python runtime (`python/`, amd64, pinned 3.12.x) with
  wxPython, comtypes (Windows SAPI 5 speech), and the other runtime wheels
  preinstalled, plus the vendored `quill-glow-core` contract wheel. End users
  install no Python.
- The `quill` package source, the hoisted `quill.exe` launcher (a stamped
  copy of `pythonw.exe`), an empty `data/` folder (the portable opt-in),
  `manifest.json`, `README.txt`.
- Docs: `docs/userguide.html` and `docs/userguide.md` (PRD and engineering docs
  are published to GitHub Pages instead of bundled).
- Optional tools under `tools/`, included only when the build was run with the
  matching `--*-dir` / `--bundle-*` flag:
  - `tools/pandoc` (document conversion)
  - `tools/speech/{dectalk,espeak-ng,kokoro,piper,openvoice}` (Read Aloud
    engines; DECtalk further split into per-voice subfolders)
  - `tools/nodejs` (portable Node for Node Quillins and the QDC TypeScript
    console)

The installer mirrors this with opt-in [Components] and `skipifsourcedoesntexist`
so a build that omits a tool still produces a valid installer.

## What the installer already does well

- Per-user by default (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`) with an elevation override
  dialog, so a standard user can install without an admin prompt.
- Non-destructive file associations: registers only under `OpenWithList` and
  `SystemFileAssociations` (HKCU), never seizing a user's chosen default app.
- Send-to-Quill right-click verbs (OCR, Open, Read aloud) generated from the
  single `quill.core.shell_verbs` registry, so the installer, the runtime
  registry writer, the CLI `--action` map, and the Settings toggles cannot
  drift. All opt-in and `uninsdeletekey`-clean.
- Screen-reader-accessible decisions made through native `MsgBox`/`Exec`
  dialogs rather than custom wizard pages.
- Honest uninstall: prompts (defaulting to No) before removing the user's
  `%APPDATA%\Quill` data, instead of silently keeping or wiping it.
- `CloseApplications=force` to avoid in-use-binary upgrade failures.
- Optional Node bootstrap via winget when the Node component is selected but no
  portable Node was bundled, with a graceful failure message.
- Solid LZMA2 compression.

## Gaps found

1. No architecture directives. The bundle is amd64, but the script never set
   `ArchitecturesAllowed` / `ArchitecturesInstallIn64BitMode`, so on a 64-bit OS
   it installed into the 32-bit `Program Files (x86)` and would even attempt to
   run on a 32-bit Windows it can never support.
2. No minimum OS. The zero-install OCR backend (`Windows.Media.Ocr`), the winget
   Node bootstrap, and modern wxPython all require Windows 10+, but the installer
   would run on Windows 7/8.1 and then fail at runtime.
3. No association-cache refresh. The fileassoc/shellverbs tasks write Explorer
   keys, but `ChangesAssociations` was not set, so Explorer would not refresh
   icons/Open-With menus until the next shell restart.
4. A dead component. `aiassistant` ("Install the Writing Assistant setup
   guide and AI connection shortcut") gated no `[Files]` payload at all -- it
   installed nothing. Showing it implies a choice that does not exist.
5. Add/Remove Programs icon. `UninstallDisplayIcon` pointed at `run-quill.cmd`,
   which has no icon, so ARP showed a blank/generic glyph.

## Changes made in this pass

All in `build_inno_setup_script()` (and `installer/quill.iss` regenerated, test
updated):

- Added `ArchitecturesAllowed=x64compatible` and
  `ArchitecturesInstallIn64BitMode=x64compatible` (covers x64 and ARM64-via-
  emulation; requires Inno Setup 6.3+).
- Added `MinVersion=10.0` to require Windows 10/11.
- Added `ChangesAssociations=yes` so Explorer refreshes after the assoc tasks.
- Removed the dead `aiassistant` component; documented that the Writing
  Assistant ships with the core bundle.
- Pointed `UninstallDisplayIcon` at `{app}\python\pythonw.exe` (a file that
  carries a real icon), falling back gracefully when no bundled runtime exists.

These are correctness and honesty fixes that do not change the bundle contents
or the opt-in model.

## Forward-looking vision (not yet implemented)

Deliberately deferred because each needs an asset, a signing identity, or a
product decision:

- Branded icon. Ship a real `quill.ico`, wire `SetupIconFile`, give every
  shortcut an `IconFilename`, and use it for ARP. Today there is no `.ico` in
  the repo, so this is blocked on an art asset.
- Code signing. Sign `Quill-Setup-<version>.exe` (and ideally the launcher) so
  SmartScreen and AT users see a verified publisher. This is a release-pipeline
  and certificate decision, configured at `ISCC` compile time, not in the
  script body.
- In-installer voice acquisition. Today bundled speech engines must be present
  at build time. A "download recommended Read Aloud voice now?" post-install
  step (mirroring the winget Node flow, with explicit consent and a checksum)
  would let a lean installer fetch Piper/Kokoro on demand.
- Update channel. The app already vendors an autoupdate library; the installer
  could register an update feed URL and an `AppMutex` so in-app updates close
  the running instance cleanly. Needs the app to expose a known mutex name.
- Repair / modify entry. Expose component add/remove without a full reinstall.
- Optional first-run accessibility prep: offer to launch QUILL straight into the
  "Personalise QUILL" wizard with the user's detected screen reader.

## Build and verify

```powershell
# Regenerate the committed installer script after editing the generator:
python -c "from scripts.build_windows_distribution import build_inno_setup_script; from pathlib import Path; Path('installer/quill.iss').write_text(build_inno_setup_script('0.5.0'), encoding='utf-8')"

# Full distribution build (bundled Python + optional tools), then compile:
python scripts/build_windows_distribution.py --bundle-python --compile-installer

# Guard tests:
python -m pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_build_windows_distribution.py -q
```

# Blocked-items completion guide — the exact path to Done on the environment-gated 1.0 features

Status as of 2026-06-03. A small set of QUILL 1.0 items are honestly "In progress"
or "Todo" in `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` because they are genuinely blocked on something that cannot
be produced or verified from a non-live development environment: there is no live AI
provider endpoint and no Windows 11 packaged-install cycle available here. None is
faked Done.

This document is the precise, file-by-file runbook for what a maintainer (on a real
Windows 11 machine with live provider credentials) must do to drive each remaining
item to verified Done. Nothing here is hand-waving: every step names the file,
function, and acceptance test. It is the operational companion to the `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`
tracker — the tracker records *what* remains; this guide records *exactly how* to
finish it.

> This guide was previously the working file `zfix2.md`. It is preserved here under
> a descriptive name so the completion steps survive scratch-file cleanup.

## Summary table

| ID | Title | State now | What's already built & tested | What only you can finish | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI-19 | Accessible subscription sign-in (OAuth device flow) | In progress | The full RFC 8628 device-flow state machine (`device_login.py`), fully unit-tested with an injected poster | Real HTTPS poster, consent dialog, DPAPI token storage, AIBackend wiring, live end-to-end run | M |
| SHELL-2 | Structured-Markdown OCR verb (AI pass) | In progress | The assistant `structure` operation + `_apply_ocr_structuring` worker wiring, unit + contract tested | One live-key run to verify quality/threading on real OCR output; quality tuning | S |
| SHELL-3 | Windows 11 modern context menu (IExplorerCommand) | Todo | The classic Explorer verb path (SHELL-1) ships and is verifiable | A compiled `IExplorerCommand` COM handler + sparse MSIX package + installer registration + real install/uninstall verification | M–L |

When all three reach Done, **Tier 2 is golden (60/60)** and the QUILL 1.0 subtotal
drops by three remaining.

---

## AI-19 — Accessible subscription sign-in (no pasted API key)

### What already exists (do not rebuild)

- `quill/core/ai/device_login.py` — a complete, wx-free, strict-typed OAuth 2.0
  Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) state machine. Public API:
  - `DeviceFlowConfig`, `DeviceCodeGrant`, `PollResult` (frozen dataclasses).
  - `request_device_code(config, *, poster)` — starts the flow.
  - `poll_once(config, grant, *, poster)` — classifies one poll into
    pending / slow_down / authorized / denied / expired / error.
  - `run_device_login(...)` — drives the full polling loop honoring `interval`,
    backing off on `slow_down`, stopping at `expires_in`.
  - `announce_device_code(grant)` — the screen-reader instruction string.
  - `describe_login_result(result)` — the spoken outcome.
  - Every network exchange is an **injected** `poster`, so the engine is already
    tested without a live endpoint (7 tests) and adds no new egress site.
- `quill/platform/windows/credential_manager.py` — DPAPI-backed Windows Credential
  Manager storage already exists:
  - `credential_manager_available()`, `load_generic_credential(target_name)`,
    `save_generic_credential(...)`, `delete_generic_credential(target_name)`,
    `StoredCredential`.
- `quill/core/assistant_ai.py` — `AssistantConnectionSettings` (the saved provider
  connection, including `api_key`), `load_assistant_connection_settings()`, and
  `_build_auth_headers(provider, host, api_key)` is where the credential is
  consumed for outbound requests.

### Exact remaining work (Windows + live provider only)

1. **Real HTTPS poster.** Add a `urlopen`-based poster (TLS-verified) that satisfies
   the `Poster` protocol in `device_login.py`. Put it in a new
   `quill/platform/windows/` or `quill/core/ai/` module (keep `device_login.py`
   itself poster-free so the GATE-9 egress inventory stays explicit — register the
   new `urlopen` site in the egress audit).
   - Acceptance: a unit test that the poster issues a POST with the correct
     `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body and parses a JSON reply; TLS
     verification is on (no `ssl._create_unverified_context`).

2. **Consent / progress dialog `DeviceLoginDialog`** in `quill/ui/`.
   - Shows: the device code, the verification URL, and the expiry; an
     "Open in browser" button; an "I've authorized — continue" button; a Cancel
     path. Must follow the A11Y-4 dialog contract (outer sizer, default button,
     `Destroy` on close, focus return to editor).
   - Speaks `announce_device_code(grant)` on open and `describe_login_result(...)`
     on completion.
   - Acceptance: a source-contract test (the cloud-safe bar) asserting the dialog
     uses `show_modal_dialog`, shows code/URL/expiry, and wires the three buttons;
     add a row to `dialogs.md` with the menu path that opens it.

3. **DPAPI token storage.** On `authorized`, persist the returned token via
   `save_generic_credential(target_name="Quill/<provider>/oauth", ...)`. Never log
   the token; never write it to the JSON connection file in plaintext.
   - Acceptance: round-trip test through the credential manager (save → load →
     delete) under a `target_name` namespaced per provider.

4. **AIBackend wiring.** Teach `assistant_ai.py` / the provider backend to resolve
   credentials as: device-login token (if present in DPAPI) → else pasted
   `api_key`. The provider must then send the device-login token in
   `_build_auth_headers`.
   - Acceptance: a unit test that, given a stored device-login token and an empty
     pasted key, the auth header carries the token; given both, the device-login
     token wins (or whatever precedence you choose — document it).

5. **Surface the entry point.** Add a "Sign in with your <provider> account" button
   to the AI provider configuration surface (the assistant setup) that launches the
   flow. Gate behind `FeatureManager` like every other AI surface.

6. **Live end-to-end verification** (the actual blocker). On a real Windows machine
   with a provider that genuinely offers an OAuth **device authorization grant** for
   API access:
   - Start the flow → QUILL shows the code + URL → you authorize in the browser →
     QUILL polls and retrieves the token → the token is used for subsequent AI
     requests → **no pasted key required**.
   - Confirm the whole flow is keyboard- and screen-reader-accessible at every step
     (NVDA/JAWS/Narrator parity).
   - **Reality check:** confirm your target provider actually exposes a public
     device-authorization endpoint for API tokens. Several major API providers do
     **not** (they issue API keys from a dashboard instead). If yours doesn't, AI-19
     cannot be honestly closed against that provider — pick one that does (or keep
     the engine ready and mark AI-19 Done only once one real provider validates it).

### Done definition for AI-19

A blind user signs in with an existing subscription via the device flow, with no
visible 51-character secret, the token is stored in DPAPI, and at least one real
provider serves AI responses using that token — all keyboard/screen-reader
accessible and registered in the GATE-9 egress audit.

## SHELL-2 — Structured-Markdown OCR verb (AI structuring pass)

### What already exists (built and tested this session)

- `quill/core/ai/assistant.py` — new `structure` operation in `_OPERATION_PROMPTS`:
  reflows raw OCR text into clean Markdown (joins scan-broken lines, groups
  paragraphs, infers headings/lists/tables) and **forbids** summarizing, adding, or
  inventing content. Reuses the existing chunking, `_wrap`, and backend, so large
  scans are handled. Unit-tested in `tests/unit/core/ai/test_structure_operation.py`
  (registration, OCR text reaches the model, the no-summarize instruction).
- `quill/ui/main_frame_image.py` — `_run_ocr_on_path(..., structured: bool = False)`
  and a new `_apply_ocr_structuring(...)` helper that, **inside the existing OCR
  worker thread** (off the UI thread, sharing the progress dialog), structures the
  recognized text via the assistant when one is available and reports available, and
  otherwise degrades safely to plain OCR with a status note saying why. The review
  dialog title and the insert status line reflect whether the structured pass ran.
- `quill/ui/main_frame.py` — `_handle_shell_request` passes
  `structured=action == "ocr-structured"`.
- Source-contract tests in `tests/unit/ui/test_ocr_review_dialog.py` assert the
  worker wiring and the structured-verb dispatch.

### Exact remaining work (needs a live AI key)

1. **One live run.** On Windows with a configured, available assistant backend:
   right-click an image/PDF → "OCR with Quill (structured Markdown)". Confirm the
   recognized text comes back as structured Markdown (headings/lists/paragraphs),
   inserted into the editor, with the "Structured OCR text inserted" status.
2. **Quality tuning.** Inspect the output on harder inputs — multi-column PDFs,
   tables, headers/footers, page numbers. If the model summarizes or drops content,
   tighten the `structure` prompt in `_OPERATION_PROMPTS` (it is the single source
   of truth) and re-run. No code path changes needed — only the prompt string.
3. **Threading/latency check.** Confirm the off-thread `assistant.transform(...)`
   call is thread-safe with your backend and that the progress dialog stays
   responsive (the worker already runs off the UI thread; verify no backend
   requires UI-thread affinity). If a backend needs main-thread marshaling, route
   the structuring call through `wx.CallAfter`-bounded handoff instead.

### Done definition for SHELL-2

The structured verb produces faithful structured Markdown from real OCR output on a
live backend, with no content loss, responsive UI, and accessible status
announcements. Then flip SHELL-2 to Done in `ROADMAP.md` (tracker + both living
lists + a dated activity-log entry) and regenerate `docs/planning/ROADMAP.html` and
`docs/planning/ROADMAP.epub`.

## SHELL-3 — Windows 11 modern context menu (IExplorerCommand) + installer

### What already exists

- `quill/platform/windows/shell_integration.py` — the **classic** (pre-Win11)
  `HKCU\Software\Classes\SystemFileAssociations\<ext>\shell\Quill.<verb>` verb path
  ships in SHELL-1 and is buildable and verifiable locally. On Windows 11 these
  verbs appear under "Show more options" (the legacy menu).

### Why this can't be finished from here

The Windows 11 **primary** context menu (the non-"Show more options" menu) only
shows verbs provided by a registered `IExplorerCommand` COM handler packaged in a
sparse/MSIX package. That requires a compiled in-proc COM component and a real
package install — none of which a pure-Python repo can produce or verify in this
environment.

### Exact remaining work (real Windows 11 + packaging toolchain)

1. **Build the `IExplorerCommand` handler.** A compiled in-proc COM server (C++/WinRT
   or Rust, or a packaged .NET COM component) that implements `IExplorerCommand`
   (and `IExplorerCommandState` / `IEnumExplorerCommand` for the submenu). It must
   surface the **same** verbs as the core registry — drive its labels/actions from
   `quill/core/shell_verbs.py` (`default_shell_verbs()`, `verb_for_action`,
   `verbs_for_extension`) so there is exactly one source of truth. Each invoked verb
   launches `quill --action <verb> "<path>"` (reuse `verb_launcher_command(action)`
   from `shell_integration.py`).
   - Submenu shape: a top "Send to Quill" flyout enumerating Open / OCR / OCR
     structured Markdown / Read aloud, filtered by file extension via
     `verbs_for_extension`.

2. **Sparse package + registration.** Author a sparse MSIX package manifest that
   declares the `IExplorerCommand` handler under the relevant
   `windows.fileTypeAssociation` / `desktop4:FileExplorerContextMenus` extension, and
   register/unregister it on install/uninstall.

3. **Installer wiring.** Wire the package register/unregister into the QUILL
   installer (`installer/quill.iss` and/or `scripts/build_windows_distribution.py`)
   so a normal install adds the modern menu and uninstall removes it cleanly. Keep
   the classic-menu fallback for non-packaged/portable installs.

4. **Live install/uninstall verification.** On Windows 11: install → confirm the
   verbs appear in the **primary** right-click menu (not just "Show more options")
   for the correct file types → run each verb → confirm uninstall removes them with
   no orphaned registry/package state. Confirm keyboard and Narrator accessibility of
   the menu entries.

### Done definition for SHELL-3

QUILL's "Send to Quill" verbs appear in the Windows 11 primary context menu via a
registered `IExplorerCommand`, driven by the same `shell_verbs.py` registry,
installed and removed cleanly by the installer, and verified on a real Win11 box.
Then flip SHELL-3 to Done in `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` and regenerate
`docs/planning/ROADMAP.html` and `docs/planning/ROADMAP.epub`.

---

## Per-change discipline reminder (applies to all three)

- Format then lint only the **specific** changed files: `ruff format <files>`,
  `ruff check <files>`. Do not run whole-tree format (it reflows unrelated drift).
- Strict `mypy` on any changed `quill/core` / `quill/io` file — must report
  "Success: no issues found"; those layers stay wx-free.
- Add at least one behavior test (or source-contract test where wx can't load) per
  change; keep the targeted `pytest` green.
- After editing `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`: update the **tracker totals**, **both living lists**,
  and add a **dated activity-log entry**, then regenerate the artifacts with
  `pandoc -s docs/planning/ROADMAP.md -o docs/planning/ROADMAP.html` and
  `pandoc -s docs/planning/ROADMAP.md -o docs/planning/ROADMAP.epub`, committing all three together.
- New user-facing dialog (e.g. `DeviceLoginDialog`) → add a row to `dialogs.md`.
- New public `MainFrame` method → regenerate the surface fixture with
  `python -m quill.tools.ui_surface --write`.
- Stage **specific files only**. Never `git add -A`.

## Appendix A (merged from former zfix4) — SHELL-3 live verification & issue status

This appendix preserves the full SHELL-3 live-verification checklist and intake issue
status that previously lived in `zfix4.md`.

### Part 1 — SHELL-3 verification steps

#### What already shipped (commit `1d3bfc4`, on `main`)

- `build_shell_verb_registry_lines()` in
  `scripts/build_windows_distribution.py` generates the Inno `[Registry]`
  verb keys directly from `quill.core.shell_verbs.default_shell_verbs()`.
- A new opt-in `[Tasks]` checkbox, `shellverbs`, gates every verb key; all
  keys carry `uninsdeletekey` for clean uninstall.
- The committed `installer/quill.iss` is regenerated to include the verbs.
- Six contract tests in
  `tests/unit/scripts/test_build_windows_distribution.py` assert per-verb /
  per-extension coverage, opt-in + uninstall-clean flags, the launch command
  shape, and end-to-end presence in the generated `.iss`.

These are all green (ruff + strict mypy + pytest). **What remains is purely a
live Windows install/uninstall pass — it cannot be done in a non-live
environment and is the only thing standing between SHELL-3 and Done.**

#### Prerequisite: install the Inno Setup 6 compiler (ISCC)

The build box does **not** currently have ISCC. Install it once:

```powershell
winget install --id JRSoftware.InnoSetup --source winget
```

Confirm it resolves (either of these should print a path):

```powershell
Get-Command ISCC.exe -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
@("C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe",
  "C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe") | Where-Object { Test-Path $_ }
```

#### Step 1 — Build the portable bundle + installer

From the repo root, with the venv active:

```powershell
# Build the portable tree, regenerate installer/quill.iss, and compile the
# installer in one pass. --bundle-python makes the result self-contained.
python -m scripts.build_windows_distribution --bundle-python --compile-installer
```

Expected: `windows-distribution\installer\Quill-Setup-<version>.exe` (and/or
`...\Output\Quill-Setup-<version>.exe`) is produced. If `--compile-installer`
is not wired as a flag in your build, compile manually:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" `
  windows-distribution\installer\quill.iss
```

#### Step 2 — Install with the "Send to Quill" verbs enabled

1. Run `Quill-Setup-<version>.exe`.
2. On the **Select Additional Tasks** page, **check**
   *"Add 'Send to Quill' actions (OCR, Open, Read aloud) to the file
   right-click menu"* (it is unchecked by default, by design).
3. Finish the install.

Accessibility check while you are here: the task checkbox label must be read
clearly by your screen reader, and the wizard must not auto-close before the
final status is announced (it is configured `CloseApplications=force`,
`RestartApplications=no`).

#### Step 3 — Verify the verbs appear and run (the core test)

The classic registry verbs surface under **"Show more options"** on
Windows 11, and directly in the **Shift+F10** keyboard context menu.

1. In **File Explorer**, navigate to a test **`.png`** (or `.jpg`, `.tif`).
2. Give it focus and press **Shift+F10** (keyboard context menu).
   - On Win11 you may need to arrow to **"Show more options"** first.
3. Confirm these items are present and screen-reader friendly:
   - **OCR with Quill**
   - **OCR with Quill (structured Markdown)** — only meaningful when AI is on
   - **Read aloud in Quill**
   (For a `.txt`/`.md`/`.html` file you should instead see **Open in Quill**
   and **Read aloud in Quill**.)
4. Activate **OCR with Quill**.
5. Confirm: a running QUILL instance is reused (or one launches), focus lands
   on the **OCR review dialog**, and an announcement states what happened.
6. Repeat once for a **`.pdf`** to confirm document handling.

> If a verb does **not** appear, the most likely causes are: the `shellverbs`
> task was left unchecked at install, or another app owns an overriding
> per-extension association. Re-run the installer and confirm the task is
> ticked. The keys are written to **HKCU** (never HKLM), so no elevation is
> needed and no other user is affected.

#### Step 4 — Confirm the registry keys exist (optional, precise)

```powershell
# Should list a "Quill.ocr" subkey with a (default) value of "OCR with Quill"
reg query "HKCU\Software\Classes\SystemFileAssociations\.png\shell\Quill.ocr" /ve
reg query "HKCU\Software\Classes\SystemFileAssociations\.png\shell\Quill.ocr\command" /ve
```

The `\command` default value should be:
`"<install>\quill.exe" -m quill --action ocr "%1"`.

#### Step 5 — Uninstall and confirm clean removal

1. Uninstall QUILL (Settings → Apps, or the Start-menu uninstaller).
2. When prompted about removing personal data, either choice is fine for this
   test (that prompt covers `%APPDATA%\Quill`, not the shell verbs).
3. Re-run the `reg query` commands from Step 4 — both must now return
   **"ERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key"**,
   proving `uninsdeletekey` cleaned up the verbs.
4. Re-check **Shift+F10** on the test `.png`: the Quill verbs must be gone.

#### Step 6 — Flip SHELL-3 to Done

Once Steps 1–5 pass on real hardware:

- In `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`: change the **SHELL-3** row Status from `In progress` to
  `Done`, move `SHELL-3` out of the two living *Work-in-progress* lists into
  the *Completed* Tier 2 list, and update the tracker totals
  (Tier 2 becomes `60 | 58 | 2 | AI-19, SHELL-2`; bump the 1.0 subtotal and
  grand total Done counts by 1).
- Add a dated activity-log entry recording the live verification pass.
- Regenerate the artifacts: `pandoc -s docs/planning/ROADMAP.md -o docs/planning/ROADMAP.html`
  and `pandoc -s docs/planning/ROADMAP.md -o docs/planning/ROADMAP.epub`.
- Stage `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` + `docs/planning/ROADMAP.html` + `docs/planning/ROADMAP.epub` only and commit.

### Part 2 — What's left, issue by issue

#### Umbrella #113 — Open & OCR from the file manager

**Status: substantially delivered on Windows; keep open as the umbrella.**
The shared groundwork it asked for is done: the action-bearing entry point
(`quill --action <verb> "<path>"`), routing through the existing
single-instance IPC, the qualifying file-type sets, and the initial action
set (Open, OCR, Read aloud) all ship via SHELL-1. Close this only when its
three sub-issues are resolved.

#### #114 — Windows Explorer context menu

**Status: classic/Show-more-options path is code-complete and tested; needs
the Part 1 live pass to call done. One sub-item is intentionally deferred.**

| Sub-item from #114 | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Classic registry verbs (`SystemFileAssociations\<ext>\shell\…`) per image ext + `.pdf` | **Done in code** (SHELL-1 runtime writer + SHELL-3 installer registration) |
| Verb invokes shared `--action` entry point over single-instance IPC | **Done** (SHELL-1) |
| Installer registration + clean uninstall | **Done in code** (SHELL-3); **needs live verify** (Part 1) |
| Reachable via Shift+F10; clear labels; focus + announcement after invoke | **Done in code**; confirmed by the Part 1 manual pass |
| **Modern Win11 menu via `IExplorerCommand` (packaged COM)** | **Deferred to a future major release** — the OS gates the primary menu behind compiled COM + package identity (sparse/MSIX). Out of scope for 1.0. |

**To finish #114 for 1.0:** run Part 1, then post a status comment noting the
modern-menu `IExplorerCommand` piece is tracked as a 2.0 follow-up, and close.

#### #115 — macOS Finder integration

**Status: Blocked, correctly. Not a 1.0 item.**
Depends on the macOS port (#42), which is not done. The OCR engine work it
describes (Apple Vision backend) also lands with the macOS port. No action now.

#### #116 — Structured OCR (AI-gated)

**Status: functionally delivered (SHELL-2), pending one live-AI verification;
the geometry/bounding-box enhancement is an optional follow-up.**

| Sub-item from #116 | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Gate behind AI + explicit `ocr_structured` opt-in setting | **Done** (SHELL-1/SHELL-2) |
| Dedicated `transform`-style op returning structured Markdown | **Done** — assistant `structure` operation |
| Feed structured result into the OCR review dialog | **Done** — `_apply_ocr_structuring` in the OCR worker |
| Plain-text behavior unchanged when AI off | **Done** — degrades safely with a status note |
| **Capture layout geometry (bounding boxes) for tables/columns** | **Not started** — optional quality enhancement; `OcrLine` has no boxes yet. Nice-to-have, can be a 2.0 follow-up. |

**To finish #116 for 1.0:** one live-key end-to-end run + structuring-quality
tuning on real multi-column / table OCR output (this is the SHELL-2 remainder),
then close noting the geometry enhancement is a future improvement.

---

## Open Tier 2 roadmap items (the honest blockers)

After SHELL-1 (Done) and this SHELL-3 work, Tier 2 stands at **57 of 60**.
The three open items and what each genuinely needs:

| ID | What's left | Blocker class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SHELL-3** | The Part 1 live install → right-click → run → uninstall pass | Windows runtime + Inno Setup install cycle |
| **SHELL-2** | One live-AI run + prompt-quality tuning on real OCR; then flip to Done | Configured/available AI backend |
| **AI-19** | Real HTTPS device-login poster, `DeviceLoginDialog`, DPAPI token storage, AIBackend wiring, live sign-in (RFC 8628 state machine already built + tested) | Live provider OAuth device endpoint + Windows runtime |

**Closest to Done:** SHELL-3 and SHELL-2 — each needs a single live pass with
no further code. AI-19 still needs real code plus a live provider.

### Explicitly out of scope for 1.0 (do not work on)

- Win11 modern primary-menu `IExplorerCommand` sparse package (the deferred
  half of #114) — 2.0.
- OCR bounding-box geometry capture (the deferred half of #116) — 2.0.
- macOS Finder (#115) — blocked on the macOS port (#42).

# Announcement style guide

This guide defines the shared grammar for every status message and
screen-reader announcement in Quill. A single predictable shape lets users of
NVDA, JAWS, and Narrator parse an outcome in one pass and builds trust that the
app always reports what it just did.

The grammar is implemented in [quill/core/announcements.py](../../quill/core/announcements.py)
(`format_announcement`, `format_progress`, `pluralize`). Use those helpers
rather than hand-building strings, and keep this document in sync with them.

## The grammar

```text
<Verb> <object>[, <count> <unit>(s)][, <detail>].
```

- **Verb.** The action. Use past tense for outcomes ("Rewrote", "Saved",
  "Replaced") and present participle for progress that precedes a slow action
  ("Rewriting", "Summarizing").
- **Object.** What was acted on: "paragraph", "document", "selection". Optional
  for verb-only outcomes such as "Copied".
- **Count and unit.** An optional quantity with an automatically pluralized
  unit and a thousands separator: "42 words", "1 word", "1,200 words",
  "2 matches".
- **Detail.** An optional trailing clause, its own comma segment.
- The sentence is capitalized and ends with a period (unless it already ends in
  `.`, `!`, or `?`).

## Examples

| Situation | Announcement |
| --- | --- |
| Rewrote the paragraph at the cursor | Rewrote paragraph, 42 words. |
| Summarized the whole document | Summarized document, 1,200 words. |
| Saved the file | Saved document. |
| Copied with no measurable object | Copied. |
| Replaced a one-word selection | Replaced selection, 1 word. |
| Nothing was selectable to act on | Nothing to rewrite. |
| Starting a slow rewrite | Rewriting paragraph, 42 words. |

## Rules

1. **Always report the outcome.** Every action that changes the document or
   state announces what happened, including the scope it chose when there was
   no selection (paragraph at the cursor, or the whole document).
2. **State the scope and count for content actions.** When an action operates on
   a body of text, include the object and the word count so the user knows the
   size of what changed.
3. **Say so when nothing happened.** If there is nothing to act on, announce it
   ("Nothing to rewrite.") instead of staying silent or sending an empty
   request.
4. **Keep it one short sentence.** No nested clauses beyond a single optional
   detail segment. Screen-reader users should not have to wait through a
   paragraph.
5. **No raw punctuation tricks.** Do not pad with parentheses or trailing
   ellipses; the helpers produce a clean sentence.
6. **Reuse the helpers.** Do not duplicate phrasing logic. Import
   `format_announcement` / `format_progress` from `quill.core.announcements`.

## Verb reference (common actions)

| Action | Progress verb | Outcome verb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rewrite | Rewriting | Rewrote |
| Summarize | Summarizing | Summarized |
| Fix grammar | Checking grammar in | Fixed grammar in |
| Continue writing | Continuing | Continued |
| Save | Saving | Saved |
| Replace | Replacing | Replaced |
| Copy | Copying | Copied |

# QUILL 1.0 final-QA test plan

Status: living document — execution owned by the maintainer for the Tier 6
release gate (DLG-3.8). This is the authoritative manual and exploratory test
plan for the QUILL 1.0 release. It complements, and does not replace, the
machine-enforced gate ladder (PR CI, Security CI, Accessibility CI) and the
`dialogs.md` manual dialog regression checklist.

## 1. Purpose and scope

This plan defines the final, human-executed quality pass required before QUILL
1.0 ships. Its job is to verify, on a real Windows runtime with real assistive
technology, the behaviours that static analysis and headless unit tests
**cannot** prove: screen-reader announcements, focus journeys, audio output,
OCR against live images, the device-login network round trip, and the felt
quality of the writing experience.

In scope:

- Every user-facing dialog enumerated in `dialogs.md`.
- Keyboard operability and focus management across the whole shell.
- Screen-reader parity (NVDA, JAWS, Narrator) for announcements and navigation.
- The QUILL key, browse mode, and Quick Nav surfaces.
- File, session, and document lifecycle (open, edit, save, recover).
- AI / assistant tool flows, including consent gating and async "busy" states.
- OCR capture and review.
- Startup, onboarding, trust-consent, and crash-recovery paths.
- Read-aloud / speech output.
- Installer and first-run on a clean machine.
- Performance and stability under realistic documents.

Out of scope for 1.0 (deferred to 2.0, tracked in `ROADMAP.md`): axe-core / Nu
Html Checker validation, BITS Whisperer, the GLOW watch-action binding
(WATCH-8), and the Accessibility Agents workstream.

## 2. Test environments

Run the full pass on at least one machine from each row. Record the exact build
identifier (version + commit) on every result.

| Environment | OS | Screen reader | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Windows 11 (latest) | NVDA (latest stable) | Baseline for every case |
| Secondary | Windows 11 (latest) | JAWS (latest) | Spot-check the high-traffic surfaces |
| Sanity | Windows 10 + Windows 11 | Narrator | Confirm no hard breakage |
| Clean-install | Fresh Windows VM, no Python | (NVDA) | Installer + first-run only |
| High contrast | Windows 11, High Contrast on | NVDA | Visual + announcement parity |

Build under test: record `version` from About Quill and the commit SHA. A pass
is only valid against a single, named build.

## 3. Entry and exit criteria

Entry criteria (all must hold before a final-QA pass begins):

- All required CI gates are green on `main`: PR CI, Security CI, Accessibility
  CI, GATE-6 (public surface), GATE-11 (module size), GATE-EC (error-code
  completeness), A11Y-4 (banned patterns and dialog registry), and the DLG-3
  `dialog_inventory.json` snapshot.
- `dialogs.md` and the `dialog_inventory.json` snapshot agree with the source
  (run `python -m quill.tools.dialog_inventory` and confirm no diff).
- The build installs cleanly on the clean-install environment.

Exit criteria (all must hold to sign off 1.0):

- Every section below has a recorded result against the named build.
- Every `dialogs.md` row carries pass/fail evidence (see §5).
- No open Critical or High severity defect (see §11).
- Each known limitation is documented in the ACR/VPAT and release notes.

## 4. Severity model

| Severity | Definition | Release impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Data loss, crash, silent network egress, or a screen-reader user cannot complete a core task | Blocks release |
| High | A core task is severely degraded, or an announcement/focus contract is broken | Blocks release unless explicitly waived |
| Medium | A non-core task is degraded, or an announcement is imprecise | Fix or document before release |
| Low | Cosmetic, or a minor wording nit | Track for a follow-up |

## 5. Evidence capture

For every test case record: build id, environment row, screen reader + version,
pass/fail, and a one-line observation. For dialog cases, capture the exact
announced title and the announced text of the default and cancel actions. For
failures, capture: reproduction steps, expected vs actual announcement/focus,
severity, and a linked issue.

Store the completed evidence alongside this plan (a dated copy of the filled
`dialogs.md` plus a results sheet) so each release has a durable record.

### 5.1 Evidence artifacts to record alongside the build id

For every pass, record the following alongside the build identifier in the
results sheet. They are the machine-checked receipts that the build under
test actually agrees with the in-repo enforcement gates.

- **`dialog_inventory.json` mtime** (`tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`):
  the snapshot must be regenerated by `python -m quill.tools.dialog_inventory --write`
  whenever a dialog is added, moved, or removed. If the in-source AST scan
  disagrees with the committed snapshot, `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  fails the build; a stale snapshot in a 1.0 release tag is a release-blocker.
- **`module_size_budgets.json` `_rebaseline_*` keys** (`quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`):
  if any `_rebaseline_<module>` key is set, the corresponding `quill/**/*.py`
  file is allowed to exceed the default 600-line cap. Record the rebaseline
  set in the results sheet so reviewers can audit each oversized module by
  hand.
- **`wxPython` runtime version** (`python -c "import wx; print(wx.__version__)"`):
  QUILL supports `wxPython 4.2.x` with `wxWidgets 3.2.x`. A test pass on
  wx 4.1 or wxWidgets 3.0 is not a 1.0 result.
- **Public surface fixture** (`tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`):
  regenerate with `python -m quill.tools.ui_surface --write` if any
  `MainFrame` public method is added or removed. The fixture is the
  GATE-6 characterization receipt.
- **`quill-glow-core` engine hash** (if GLOW is exercised on the build):
  the shared engine in `quill/core/glow.py` is the cross-platform spine;
  record the engine version any time a GLOW surface is in the pass.

If any of the five artifacts above changed during the pass, the diff must
be present in the commit history of the release branch; a release tag
without these diffs is not a clean 1.0.

## 6. Dialog estate pass (covers DLG-2, DLG-3.6, DLG-3.8)

The authoritative list is `dialogs.md` (sections A–X). Do not duplicate it here;
execute it directly. The contract every dialog must satisfy is the A11Y-4
contract restated at the top of `dialogs.md`:

1. It opens from the listed command or menu path.
2. Tab and Shift+Tab reach every control in a sensible order.
3. The screen reader announces the dialog title and each control.
4. Enter activates the default action; Escape and the close button cancel.
5. On close, focus returns to the editor.
6. The dialog never traps, freezes, or goes silent.

Screen-reader coverage matrix for the dialog estate:

| Surface group (`dialogs.md`) | NVDA | JAWS | Narrator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. File / session | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| B. Settings, palette, menu editor | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| C. Navigate (Go To, Outline, bookmarks) | Full | — | Sanity |
| D–F. Text analysis, accessibility, intake | Full | — | Sanity |
| G. Read aloud + OCR (incl. OCR Review) | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| H. Sticky notes | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| I–P. Formats, compare, keyboard, macros | Full | — | Sanity |
| Q. AI and assistant (DLG-2 / DLG-3.6) | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| R. BITS Whisperer | Out of scope for 1.0 | — | — |
| S–T. Help, features, startup, support | Full | Spot | Sanity |
| U. Selection and QUILL key | Full | — | Sanity |
| V. Nested and secondary dialogs | Full | — | Sanity |
| W. Power Tools | Full | — | Sanity |
| X. Startup-only (crash recovery, trust) | Full | Spot | Sanity |

"Full" = exercise the complete A11Y-4 contract. "Spot" = open, confirm title +
default + Escape + focus return. "Sanity" = open and confirm it is not silent or
trapped. JAWS spot priority: startup, the assistant/AI tools, sticky notes, and
watch profiles (the surfaces with live lists, async work, and chained modals).

Special attention for the AI/assistant tools (Q) — the DLG-2 / DLG-3.6
acceptance the maintainer is signing off:

- Each long-running action disables its trigger before work starts and
  re-enables on completion.
- "Busy" state is announced; the surface never appears hung.
- Results marshalled back to the UI thread are announced once, not duplicated.
- A worker exception surfaces as an announced error, not a silent failure.
- No cloud/AI action runs without an explicit, per-action consent.

## 7. Keyboard and focus pass

- Tab order is sensible and complete on the main shell and every dialog.
- No keyboard trap anywhere; Escape always has a defined meaning.
- The QUILL key prefix (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave` by default) enters, announces, times
  out, and is remappable; the old default stops working after a remap.
- Browse mode enters, announces, navigates by element, and times out.
- Quick Nav / Heading Organizer / Outline Navigator move the caret and announce.
- Status-bar cells are reachable, announce their value, and expose their menu.
- Focus returns to the editor after every modal closes.

## 8. File, session, and document lifecycle

- Open, edit, save, Save As, and encoding selection round-trip correctly.
- Dirty-state title suffix appears and clears accurately.
- Prompt-to-save offers Save / Don't Save / Cancel and honours each.
- Multi-tab switch wraps correctly and is announced.
- Session save/open restores the working set.
- Atomic writes: a forced failure mid-save never corrupts the original file;
  `.bak` / recovery behaves per the data-layout contract.
- Restore Backup recovers a prior version.

## 9. AI, consent, and privacy pass

- No outbound document content without an explicit, visible, per-action consent.
- The consent surface states what will be sent and to where before sending.
- A declined consent cancels the action and announces the cancellation.
- API keys are stored via DPAPI; "Forget API Key" clears them and confirms.
- The device-login round trip (AI-19) completes against the live endpoint on a
  real network (cannot be verified headless).
- No document text appears in any log file after an AI action.

## 10. OCR pass (OCR-1, OCR-3)

Requires a live display, clipboard, and OCR engine, so it cannot be verified
headless.

- OCR Image, OCR Clipboard Image, and OCR Screen Capture each produce text.
- The screen-capture target chooser offers whole screen vs active window.
- OCR Review opens after completion, is fully keyboard/SR operable, and inserts
  the accepted text at the caret.
- A failed or empty OCR announces a clear outcome, not silence.

## 11. Startup, onboarding, and recovery pass

- First run shows onboarding; consent is recorded only on explicit accept.
- A declined trust-consent at startup closes the app rather than continuing.
- Each deferred startup step is isolated: a forced failure in one step logs to
  `logs/startup-errors.log` and keeps QUILL open.
- Crash Recovery appears after an unclean exit and restores or discards per the
  user's choice.
- The Untrusted Location Warning appears for files from untrusted folders.

## 12. Read-aloud and speech pass

- Read Aloud Voice Settings and Read Aloud Settings apply and persist.
- Generate Speech Audio produces a file and announces completion.
- Voice selection chain falls back gracefully when an engine is unavailable.

## 13. Installer and first-run pass (clean machine)

- The installer runs to completion on a fresh Windows VM with no Python.
- Single-instance behaviour holds (a second launch focuses the first).
- First launch reaches a usable editor with a screen reader running.
- Uninstall removes the app and leaves user data per the documented policy.

## 14. Performance and stability pass

- Open and edit a large document (target sizes per the PERF acceptance rows)
  without UI-thread stalls; cross-thread updates marshal through `wx.CallAfter`.
- Typing latency stays within the documented budget on the primary environment.
- No memory growth over a sustained editing session.
- The diagnostics bundle (Save Diagnostics) collects without document content.

## 15. High-contrast and visual pass

- High Contrast mode renders every surface legibly; nothing disappears.
- Focus indicators remain visible.
- Contrast validation tooling reports the shipped theme as compliant.

## 16. Localization sanity

- The shipped locales load; no layout breaks truncate a control's name.
- Announcements remain grammatical in each shipped locale.

## 17. Sign-off

Final sign-off is recorded by the maintainer against a single named build when
every section has evidence, `dialogs.md` is fully ticked for that build, and no
open Critical or High defect remains. This sign-off closes DLG-3.8 and, with it,
the deferred SR-verification criteria of DLG-2 and DLG-3.6.

| Role | Name | Build | Date | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maintainer (SR sign-off) | | | | |

## Release types

| Type | Description | Tag pattern |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Beta | Pre-release for wider testing | `v0.5.0-beta.1` |
| Stable | Production release | `v1.0.0` |
| Hotfix | Critical-only patch | `v1.0.1` |

All three go through the same `windows-release` workflow. Mark betas as
`prerelease: true` in the GitHub release (already the default in the
workflow).

---

## Building a Windows release

The build workflow (`windows-release.yml`) runs on `push` to a `v*` tag.
To trigger it manually:

```powershell
git tag v0.5.0-beta.1
git push origin v0.5.0-beta.1
```

The workflow produces three artifacts:

- `quill-installer` — Inno Setup `.exe` installer
- `quill-portable` — standalone folder, no installer required
- `quill-release-artifacts` — checksums, SBOM, update feed stub

To build locally (requires Inno Setup 6 and Python 3.12):

```powershell
pip install -e .[ui,spellcheck,dev]
python scripts/build_windows_distribution.py `
    --bundle-python `
    --compile-installer `
    --iscc-path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" `
    --output-dir windows-distribution
```

---

## Update mechanism overview

QUILL uses the AccessibleApps `autoupdate` library (vendored at
`quill/_vendor/autoupdate/`) for incremental over-the-air updates.

The flow:

1. `QuillUpdateManager.check_for_updates()` is called (on startup or from
   Help > Check for Updates).
2. The manager fetches the update feed JSON from a hosted endpoint.
3. If the feed version is newer than the running version, the user is
   prompted via `_on_update_available`.
4. If accepted, the update ZIP is downloaded with progress announcements.
5. The ZIP is extracted to a temp directory.
6. The platform bootstrapper (`bootstrap.exe` on Windows) is moved out of
   the extracted tree and executed.
7. The bootstrapper waits for QUILL to exit, then copies the new files over
   the installation and restarts the app.

The manager announces all state changes through the screen-reader bridge
(`prism_bridge.announce`) so users with NVDA/JAWS/Narrator hear every step
without watching the UI.

---

## Update feed format

The feed is a single JSON file served over HTTPS. Example:

```json
{
  "current_version": "0.5.0",
  "description": "Accessibility improvements and bug fixes. See the release notes for details.",
  "published_at": "2026-06-12T14:00:00Z",
  "downloads": {
    "Windows": "https://releases.example.com/quill-0.5.0-windows.zip",
    "Darwin":  "https://releases.example.com/quill-0.5.0-macos.zip",
    "Linux":   "https://releases.example.com/quill-0.5.0-linux.zip"
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `current_version` — the version string clients compare against their
  running version. See [version numbering](#version-numbering) for the
  comparison rules.
- `description` — shown to the user in the update prompt. Keep it one or
  two sentences; longer notes belong in the release notes URL.
- `downloads` — key is the `platform.system()` return value (`Windows`,
  `Darwin`, `Linux`). A client whose platform is not present skips the
  update silently.

Generate the feed with the bundled script:

```powershell
python scripts/generate_app_updater_feed.py `
    --version "0.5.0" `
    --windows-url "https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-0.5.0-windows.zip" `
    --macos-url   "https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-0.5.0-macos.zip" `
    --linux-url   "https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-0.5.0-linux.zip" `
    --description "Accessibility improvements and bug fixes." `
    --output docs/site/updates/.quill-app-updater-v1.json
```

Commit and push; the GitHub Pages workflow publishes it automatically.

---

## Building an update archive

The update ZIP must contain:

```
quill/                   all application Python files
quill-data/              data files (words_alpha, thesaurus, schemas, quillins)
bootstrap.exe            Windows bootstrapper (see below)
```

The bootstrapper **must be at the root of the ZIP** (not in a subdirectory)
so `move_bootstrap` can find it. The rest of the layout must match the
structure that `bootstrap.exe` expects when copying files over the existing
installation.

Use `scripts/build_update_zip.py` to produce the update ZIP automatically.
It handles delta computation, bootstrapper placement, and `UPDATE_MANIFEST.json`
generation. See [Update ZIP scripts](#update-zip-scripts) for full usage.

> The bootstrapper binaries are not checked into this repo because they are
> native executables maintained upstream. Run `scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py`
> to download them, or see
> `quill/_vendor/autoupdate/bootstrappers/README.txt` for manual instructions.

---

## Bootstrapper binaries

The bootstrapper (`bootstrap.exe` on Windows, `bootstrap-mac.sh` on macOS,
`bootstrap-lin.sh` on Linux) is built and maintained by the AccessibleApps
project:

    https://github.com/accessibleapps/app_updater

To obtain the binaries for a release build, use the bundled fetch script:

```powershell
python scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py
```

This downloads all three bootstrappers from the upstream repo, verifies
their SHA-256 hashes, and records checksums in
`quill/_vendor/autoupdate/bootstrappers/checksums.sha256`. Re-running is
idempotent — files with matching checksums are skipped.

The binaries are not required for development or running tests. They are
only needed when building a distributable package that supports in-place
updates.

Add the `bootstrappers/` directory to the Windows installer via the Inno
Setup script generated by `build_windows_distribution.py`. The script
already includes a `[Files]` directive for the bootstrapper; verify it
points to the correct path before compiling.

---

## Update ZIP scripts

Three scripts in `scripts/` automate the update ZIP pipeline. All three are
stdlib-only and require no extra dependencies beyond what `pip install -e .`
already installs.

### `scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py`

Downloads `bootstrap.exe`, `bootstrap-lin.sh`, and `bootstrap-mac.sh` from
the AccessibleApps upstream repo and writes a `checksums.sha256` file for
verification. Binaries land in `quill/_vendor/autoupdate/bootstrappers/` and
are excluded from git.

```powershell
# Download (idempotent — skips files whose SHA-256 matches the recorded checksum)
python scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py

# Force re-download regardless of checksum
python scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py --force

# Verify existing files without downloading
python scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py --verify-only
```

The CI `build` job runs this automatically before compiling the installer.

### `scripts/generate_file_manifest.py`

Walks `quill/` and records the SHA-256 hash, size, and install path of every
distributable file. Output is `docs/site/updates/manifests/manifest-{version}.json`.
The manifest feeds `build_update_zip.py` to compute deltas.

```powershell
# Generate manifest for the current source tree
python scripts/generate_file_manifest.py --version 0.5.0

# Generate and compare against a previous release
python scripts/generate_file_manifest.py --version 0.5.0 --compare-to 0.4.9
```

Excluded from the manifest: `quill/tools/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`.
The `--compare-to` flag prints changed, added, and deleted file counts and a
net size delta — useful for sanity-checking before cutting a release.

### `scripts/build_update_zip.py`

Produces the update ZIP consumed by the autoupdate bootstrapper. By default
it runs in delta mode: only files whose SHA-256 changed since the previous
manifest are included, keeping update ZIPs lean.

```powershell
# Delta update (auto-detects base version from available manifests)
python scripts/build_update_zip.py --version 0.5.0

# Force full update
python scripts/build_update_zip.py --version 0.5.0 --mode full

# Specify base version explicitly
python scripts/build_update_zip.py --version 0.5.0 --mode delta --base-version 0.4.9

# Target a non-Windows platform
python scripts/build_update_zip.py --version 0.5.0 --platform macos
```

The ZIP always contains:

- `bootstrap.exe` (or platform equivalent) at the root
- `UPDATE_MANIFEST.json` at the root — lists which files were changed, added,
  or deleted
- Changed/added files under `python/Lib/site-packages/` (the portable
  distribution layout)

If no previous manifest exists, the script falls back to full mode
automatically.

### Running the full pipeline

```powershell
# 1. Fetch bootstrappers (once per release machine)
python scripts/fetch_bootstrappers.py

# 2. Generate the manifest for this version
python scripts/generate_file_manifest.py --version 0.5.0

# 3. Build the delta update ZIP
python scripts/build_update_zip.py --version 0.5.0

# Output: release-artifacts/quill-0.5.0-update-windows.zip
```

The CI `build` job runs all three steps automatically on each `v*` tag push.

---

## Hosting the feed

### GitHub Pages (default)

The update feed lives at:

    docs/site/updates/.quill-app-updater-v1.json

The `github-pages` workflow publishes the entire `docs/site/` tree on every
push to `main`. The feed URL used by `QuillUpdateManager` should be:

    https://community-access.github.io/quill/updates/.quill-app-updater-v1.json

Update `UPDATE_FEED_ENDPOINT` in `quill/core/settings_specs.py` (or
wherever the URL is configured) before the first beta that ships the update
check.

### Keeping the feed up to date

Workflow: after every release, regenerate the feed, commit it, and push.
The Pages deployment runs automatically:

```powershell
python scripts/generate_app_updater_feed.py --version "0.5.1" ...
git add docs/site/updates/.quill-app-updater-v1.json
git commit -m "chore: update feed to 0.5.1"
git push
```

Do not update the feed until all platform ZIPs are uploaded and their URLs
are stable. Clients check the feed on startup; a partial update (feed
updated before ZIPs are live) will offer a broken download to users.

---

## Publishing a release

1. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` and commit.
2. Tag the commit: `git tag v0.5.0 && git push origin v0.5.0`
3. The `windows-release` workflow runs automatically:
   - runs tests (with `--ignore` for the two known-hanging tests)
   - builds the installer and portable ZIP
   - uploads artifacts
   - creates a GitHub release draft
4. Download the portable ZIP artifact, add the bootstrapper at the root,
   re-upload as the final update ZIP to the GitHub release.
5. Generate the update feed pointing at the final ZIP URLs.
6. Commit and push the feed; Pages deploys within minutes.
7. Announce the release (release notes, mailing list, etc.).

---

## Pack distribution

Packs (Quillins) are distributed as `.zip` archives containing a
`manifest.json` validated against `quill/core/schemas/extension.json`.

### Creating a pack

```powershell
# Directory structure:
my-pack/
  manifest.json
  README.md
  LICENSE
  <script-or-data files>

# Validate before distributing:
python -m quill.tools.quillin_lint my-pack --strict

# Package:
Compress-Archive -Path my-pack -DestinationPath my-pack-1.0.zip
```

### Distributing a pack

Packs can be distributed through any channel — GitHub Releases, a personal
website, email. Users install them via Tools > Quillin Manager > Install
from File.

For packs that should ship bundled with QUILL, place them in
`quill/quillins_bundled/` and submit a pull request. Bundled Quillins are
linted in CI with `--strict` and require a `README.md`, a `LICENSE`, and a
`manifest.json` with a `justification` for each capability requested.

### Pack versioning

Pack versions are free-form strings in `manifest.json`. There is no
automatic update mechanism for packs; users re-install a newer `.zip` to
upgrade.

---

## Version numbering

QUILL uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). The vendored autoupdate
library (`quill/_vendor/autoupdate/autoupdate.py`) compares versions with a
tuple-based integer comparison:

```python
tuple(int(x) for x in str(v).split("."))
```

This correctly orders `1.9` before `1.10`. The upstream library used a plain
string comparison (`"1.9" > "1.10"` evaluates True — wrong). The fix is
in `_version_tuple()` in the vendored copy; the upstream issue should be
tracked at https://github.com/accessibleapps/app_updater if a PR is
contributed.

---

## Testing updates locally

To test the full update pipeline without publishing a real release:

1. Start a local HTTP server:

   ```powershell
   python -m http.server 8765 --directory /path/to/test-assets
   ```

2. Create a test feed at `/path/to/test-assets/feed.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "current_version": "99.0.0",
     "description": "Local test update",
     "downloads": { "Windows": "http://localhost:8765/test-update.zip" }
   }
   ```

3. Create `test-update.zip` containing the app files and `bootstrap.exe`.

4. Override the feed URL in a dev settings file (do not commit):

   ```python
   # quill/core/settings.py — temporary, revert before committing
   update_feed_endpoint = "http://localhost:8765/feed.json"
   ```

5. Run QUILL and trigger Help > Check for Updates.

The screen reader should announce "Quill 99.0.0 is available", then
progress during download, then "Update ready. Quill will restart...".

For CI-safe automated tests, see `tests/unit/ui/test_update_manager.py`.
All HTTP is mocked; the bootstrapper execution step is always stubbed.

---

## Rollback

To roll back to a previous version after a bad release:

1. Update the feed to point at the previous version's ZIP:

   ```powershell
   python scripts/generate_app_updater_feed.py `
       --version "0.4.9" `
       --windows-url "https://.../quill-0.4.9-windows.zip" ...
   ```

2. Commit and push. Clients on 0.5.0 will be offered the 0.4.9 update on
   their next startup check.

   Note: `"0.4.9" > "0.5.0"` is false under string comparison, so the
   rollback feed will **not** be offered automatically. You must either:

   - Republish as a higher version number (e.g., `0.5.1-hotfix`) containing
     the older code, or
   - Ask users to reinstall manually.

   This is a known limitation of string-comparison versioning. Plan hotfix
   releases as forward increments.

---

## Best practices

**Do not update the feed before the ZIPs are live.** Users who start QUILL
in the window between feed publication and ZIP upload will get a failed
download.

**Keep description text short.** The description is read aloud by the
screen reader when the update dialog opens. Two sentences maximum; link to
the full release notes instead of embedding them.

**Sign the ZIPs.** The autoupdate library downloads and extracts ZIPs
without verifying a signature. For the beta, this is acceptable. Before
1.0, add SHA-256 checksums to the feed and verify them in
`QuillUpdateManager` before calling `extract_update`.

**Test the bootstrapper on a clean machine before each major release.**
The bootstrapper is a native binary that replaces files on disk. Run it
manually on a clean install once per release cycle to confirm the file-copy
logic matches the new distribution layout.

**Announce update availability through the screen reader, not a modal.**
The current `_on_update_available` implementation returns `True` without
showing a dialog. Before 1.0, replace this with a non-modal notification
bar (or a simple Yes/No dialog that is immediately reachable with Tab).
Never block QUILL startup on an update prompt.

**Staged rollout.** For major versions, serve the new feed to a fraction of
users first. This is not natively supported by autoupdate; implement it by
hosting multiple feed URLs (e.g., `/updates/beta.json` and
`/updates/stable.json`) and shipping beta builds that point at the beta
feed.

# Appendix: AccessibleApps integration

_Folded in from the former docs/QUILL-PRD.md on 2026-06-13._

# AccessibleApps Integration Strategy for Quill

## Overview

Quill now integrates multiple libraries from AccessibleApps (MIT-licensed) to accelerate accessibility improvements, enable incremental updates, and provide battle-tested UI components across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Components Integrated

### 1. **app_updater** (Incremental Updates)
**Status**: Implemented (production-ready)  
**Files**: 
- `scripts/generate_app_updater_feed.py` — generates JSON feed in autoupdate format
- `quill/ui/update_manager.py` — callback integration with screen-reader announcements
- `pyproject.toml` — autoupdate dependency added to core

**What it enables**:
- Micro-updates: Ship patches as small ZIPs containing only changed files, not full reinstalls.
- Automatic bootstrapper: Platform-specific scripts (`bootstrap.exe`, `bootstrap-mac.sh`, `bootstrap-lin.sh`) apply updates atomically after app exit and restart.
- Accessible UX: Update checks and progress announced via screen reader with explicit user consent.
- Security: Feeds can be cryptographically signed (Ed25519/RSA) and verified client-side.

**Developer notes**:
- Call `UpdateManager.check_for_updates()` from Help menu or startup checks.
- Callbacks route through `prism_bridge.announce()` for screen-reader compatibility.
- CI must produce ZIP update packages in release pipeline (full installer flow unchanged).
- Test bootstrapper atomicity on Windows (NVDA/Narrator) and macOS (VoiceOver).

---

### 2. **smart_list** (Virtual Lists)
**Status**: Optional (integration in progress)  
**Files**: 
- `pyproject.toml` — smart_list added to `[project.optional-dependencies.ui]`
- Prototype: `quill/ui/smartlist_adapter.py` (to be created)

- Virtual scrolling for large outlines/lists (millions of items without memory blowup).
- Accessible DataView on macOS, ListView on Windows/Linux — unified API across platforms.
- Model-based columns via attribute, dict key, or callable — maps naturally to Quill document models.
- Windows IAT hook bypass for UIA enumeration delays on virtual lists >100K items.

**Developer notes**:
- Keep smart_list use confined to `quill/ui` (it imports `wx`).
- Prototype: wrap SmartList/VirtualSmartList in an adapter that matches Quill's existing list interface.
- Test with NVDA/Narrator (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS) for focus and announcement behavior.
- Intended for outline navigator and large-document list views.

---

### 3.5. **html_to_text** (HTML Paste Cleaning)
**Status**: Fully integrated (production-ready)  
**Files**: 
- `quill/ui/html_paste_cleaner.py` — HTML detection and cleaning logic
- `quill/ui/main_frame.py` — integrated into magic_paste() function
- `tests/unit/ui/test_html_paste_cleaner.py` — 21 comprehensive tests
- `quill/core/settings.py` — `auto_clean_html_paste` setting (currently defaults to `False`)
- `pyproject.toml` — html_to_text added to `[project.optional-dependencies.ui]`

**What it enables**:
- Automatic HTML detection from web browser pastes (blog posts, emails, articles).
- One-click conversion to clean plain text while preserving structure (headings, links, lists).
- Optional auto-clean mode via Settings → Paste (currently opt-in for user safety).
- Fallback regex-based cleaning if html_to_text library is unavailable.
- No silent stripping; user controls every paste action via Magic Paste picker.

**Workflow**:
1. User copies HTML from web browser or email client.
2. User presses Ctrl+Shift+V (Magic Paste).
3. Quill detects HTML and shows picker:
   - "Paste HTML as clean text" (recommended)
   - "Paste HTML as-is" (original raw HTML)
   - "Paste as plain text" (fallback)
4. User chooses; clean version is inserted immediately.

**Developer notes**:
- `analyze_paste(text) → HtmlPasteContext`: Fast heuristic detection (doesn't require html_to_text import to detect).
- `clean_html(html) → str`: Uses html_to_text if available; falls back to regex stripping.
- Heuristic detects HTML tags but avoids false positives (code samples, email footers).
- All 21 tests passing: detection, cleaning, fallback, edge cases, integration scenarios.
- Screen-reader integration: Status bar announces cleanup (e.g., "Pasted cleaned HTML (350 chars)").

---

### 4. **accessible_output2** (Braille + Speech Fallback)
**Status**: Optional (recommended for later)  
**Files**: None yet — planned as fallback in `quill/platform/windows/prism_bridge.py`

**What it enables**:
- Braille output when Prism backend doesn't support it.
- Fallback speech when Prism runtime is unavailable (graceful degradation).
- Mature support for NVDA, JAWS, Narrator via multiple speech backends.

**Developer notes**:
- Do NOT add as a hard dependency; keep Prism as the primary backend.
- Create an optional adapter `quill/platform/windows/accessible_output_adapter.py` that:
  - Detects accessible_output2 availability at import time.
  - Exposes `speak(message, interrupt)` matching Prism's interface.
  - Falls back to `accessible_output2` if Prism probe fails or braille is needed.
- This is a future enhancement after Prism stabilizes and user demand for braille surfaces.

---

### 4. **app_elements** (Common Dialogs)
**Status**: Candidate for selective adoption  
**Files**: None yet — audit and wrap per-component

**What it enables**:
- Pre-built about boxes, standard dialogs, and reusable UI elements.
- Reduces boilerplate for non-editor UI.

**Developer notes**:
- Do NOT wholesale-import; audit each component for Quill's dialog contracts (default buttons, focus return, accessible names).
- Create wrappers in `quill/ui/app_elements_compat.py` that enforce Quill dialog rules.
- Use selectively for About dialog, license viewer, and settings panels.

---

### 5. **platform_utils** (Clipboard, Paths, Stdout)
**Status**: Candidate for later  
**Files**: None yet

**What it enables**:
- Cross-platform clipboard, path normalization, stdout capture — small utilities to reduce boilerplate.

**Developer notes**:
- Low-risk adoption for small utilities.
- Can be integrated incrementally if Quill's platform layer needs it.

---

## Update Process: How It Works

### 1. **Release Pipeline**
```
quill/version.py → scripts/generate_app_updater_feed.py
                  ↓
                  Produces: docs/site/updates/.quill-app-updater-v1.json
                  Format: { "current_version", "description", "downloads": { "Windows": "...", "Darwin": "...", "Linux": "..." } }
```

### 2. **User Workflow (Automatic or Manual)**
```
User: Help → Check for Updates
       ↓
quill/ui/update_manager.py: UpdateManager.check_for_updates()
       ↓
autoupdate library:
  - Downloads update ZIP to staging directory
  - Announces progress via quill.platform.windows.prism_bridge.announce()
  - Calls update_complete_callback() when ready
       ↓
Platform bootstrapper (after app exit):
  - Waits for Quill process to exit
  - Replaces old files with new files from ZIP
  - Restarts Quill
```

### 3. **Micro-Update Example**
```
Release 1.0.0: Full installer (30 MB)
Release 1.0.1: Micro-update ZIP (2 MB)
  - One file changed (bug fix in core)
  - User downloads 2 MB instead of 30 MB
  - Update applied atomically on next startup
```

---

## Attribution & Licensing

All AccessibleApps libraries are **MIT-licensed**. Attribution is documented in:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — "Acknowledgments and Attribution" section
- Individual module docstrings (e.g., `quill/ui/update_manager.py`)
- Release notes (when a library is integrated into a shipped version)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (v1.0)
1. ✅ Integrate `app_updater` feed generator and update callbacks.
2. ✅ Document update process in user guide and PRD.
3. ✅ Add AccessibleApps attribution to CONTRIBUTING.md.
4. ✅ Fully integrate `html_to_text` with Magic Paste HTML detection and cleaning (21 tests passing).
5. Test app_updater flow locally on Windows (bootstrapper atomicity).
6. Set up CI to produce ZIP update packages alongside full installers.

### Short-term (v1.1 – v1.5)
1. Wire html_to_text auto-clean setting into UI (Settings → Paste → Auto-clean HTML).
2. Prototype and integrate `smart_list` for outlines and large lists.
3. Test `smart_list` on macOS (DataView) and Windows (ListView) with screen readers.
4. Consider selective `app_elements` adoption for dialogs.
5. Evaluate `accessible_output2` braille support if user demand arises.

### Future
- Optional: Add `platform_utils` for clipboard and cross-platform utilities.
- Optional: Integrate `html_to_text` for import/export workflows.
- Optional: Evaluate `opml_lib` if Quill adds outline import/export.

# Appendix: Native RTF editing and Ulysses study (design)

_Folded in from the former docs/QUILL-PRD.md on 2026-06-13._

# QUILL: Native RTF Editing and a Ulysses Competitive Study

Two forward-looking proposals in one place. Part One asks what it would take for
QUILL to host a real rich-text editing surface so a writer can choose between
plain-text-first writing and live rich editing. Part Two studies Ulysses, the
Apple Design Award winning writing app for Mac, iPad, and iPhone, and recommends
which of its ideas QUILL should adopt without compromising its accessibility-first
soul.

Both parts are written to be ambitious. They are also written honestly: where an
idea collides with a non-negotiable QUILL principle, the collision is named and a
safer path is offered.

---

## Part One: Native RTF Editing as an Optional Surface

> **What shipped (0.8.1 Beta 1) — hidden-codes first.** The plan of record for this
> work became **hidden-codes formatting** rather than a WYSIWYG editing surface;
> the full design and phasing are in
> [`docs/planning/rtf.md`](../planning/rtf.md). What is delivered: real document
> formatting (font family/size, colour, highlight, underline, strikethrough,
> super/subscript; paragraph alignment, line spacing, indent, named styles, page
> breaks) applied from the **Format** menu and the accessible **Font…** dialog,
> stored as *invisible* codes over the clean plain-text buffer, interrogated on
> demand with **Describe Formatting at Cursor** (and an optional announce-on-move),
> and **materialised at export** to Word (`.docx`, native writer + Pandoc
> fallback), RTF, and HTML — with honest-fidelity warnings before any lossy save.
> The plain-text buffer stays the single editing surface, so undo, search, the
> outline, metrics, read-aloud, and AI keep working unchanged. The **read-only
> rich-text lens** below remains an opt-in preview gated behind
> `core.rich_text_lens` (pending the live JAWS/NVDA/Narrator pass), and the fully
> **editable WYSIWYG surface** described in this Part is **deferred to a future major release**.
> The vision narrative is retained below for the record.

### The idea in one sentence

Let a writer open Preferences and choose their editing surface: keep the current
plain-text-first editor (a `wx.TextCtrl` over Markdown-style markup), or switch to
a native rich-text surface (a hosted `wx.RichTextCtrl`) where bold, italic,
headings, lists, and links are shown as formatted text rather than as markup
characters, and `.rtf` files open and save with no markup translation at all.

### Why this is different from what exists today

QUILL already supports RTF as a *file format*. The io-layer round-trip delivered
under EDS-21 reads RTF into Markdown-style markup and writes that markup back out
to valid RTF. See [quill/io/rtf.py](quill/io/rtf.py). That work is real and it
stays valuable. What it deliberately does not do is change the editing surface:
when you open an `.rtf` today, you edit markup in a plain-text control, and the
formatting is a translation, not a live object.

This proposal is about the surface itself. It introduces a second, opt-in editor
control where formatting is native and visible, and where RTF is the document's
true in-memory representation rather than a serialized export of markup.

### The headline tension, stated plainly

QUILL's founding principle is screen-reader-first, plain-text-first writing on
stock controls. The PRD and the repository conventions are explicit that the
writing path should use `wx.TextCtrl` and avoid custom-drawn or heavily
rich-formatted editor controls, because plain stock controls give the most
predictable, best-tested screen-reader experience across NVDA, JAWS, and
Narrator.

A `wx.RichTextCtrl` is a richer, more complex control. On Windows its
accessibility exposure is good but not identical to a plain edit control, and on
macOS and Linux the wx rich-text implementation behaves differently again. So the
core design question is not "can we host an RTF control" (we can) but "can we host
it without weakening the accessibility guarantee that defines QUILL." The answer
this proposal defends: yes, but only as an explicit, clearly-announced,
non-default choice, with the plain-text surface remaining the supported default
and the rich surface treated as a power-user mode with its own honest
accessibility disclosure.

### What "magical" looks like here

The magic is not the formatting. Every word processor has formatting. The magic
is making a rich surface feel as calm, legible, and screen-reader-honest as the
plain surface, and letting a writer move between the two without ever losing a
word.

- One document, two lenses. The same file can be viewed as markup or as live
  formatting, and switching lenses is a single command with a spoken summary of
  what changed and what, if anything, cannot survive the switch.
- A spoken formatting model. When the caret enters bold text, QUILL says "bold"
  the way it already announces actions, so formatting is something you hear, not
  only something sighted users see. This is the feature Microsoft Word and
  Ulysses never built for screen-reader users, and it is where QUILL can lead.
- Honest fidelity. Before any potentially lossy conversion, QUILL tells you in
  plain language what will be preserved and what will be flattened, and offers to
  keep a sidecar copy. No silent data loss, ever.

### Architecture: where this lives

QUILL's layering rules are strict. `quill/core` and `quill/io` must stay free of
`wx`. All widget code lives in `quill/ui` and `quill/platform`. This proposal
respects that boundary completely.

- A new editor-surface abstraction in `quill/ui` (for example
  `quill/ui/editor_surface.py`) defines a small protocol that both the plain-text
  surface and the rich surface implement: get and set the document text, get and
  set selection, apply and query inline formatting, report the caret context, and
  emit change and caret events. The rest of `quill/ui/main_frame.py` talks to the
  surface through this protocol instead of touching `self.editor` directly.
- The plain-text surface wraps today's `wx.TextCtrl` and is the default.
- The rich surface wraps a `wx.RichTextCtrl` and is selected only when the writer
  opts in.
- A pure, `wx`-free RTF formatting model can live in `quill/io` (extending the
  existing `quill/io/rtf.py`) so that conversion logic stays testable on Linux CI
  where `wx` cannot be imported. The control reads and writes through that model.

This is the single most important design decision: introduce a surface protocol
so the two controls are interchangeable from the application's point of view. Without
it, every one of the command surfaces below would need a branch for "is this the
rich control or the plain control." With it, each command asks the surface to do
the work and the surface knows how.

### Impact across every command surface

This is the heart of the proposal. The instruction to "keep in mind all command
surfaces that could be impacted" is taken literally. The table below inventories
the real call sites discovered in the codebase and rates the work each one needs
to support a rich surface. The plain-text surface keeps working unchanged in every
row; the rating describes the rich-surface effort.

Effort key: Low means the existing logic works through the surface protocol with
little change. Medium means the command needs a rich-aware path. High means the
command needs genuine new design because formatting changes its meaning.

| Command surface | Representative call sites | Rich-surface effort | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Editor creation and event binding | `_create_document_tab`, `_bind_editor_events`, `_on_editor_char_hook` in [quill/ui/main_frame.py](quill/ui/main_frame.py) | High | The control is constructed here; this is where the surface protocol and the two implementations plug in. Smart-quote and dash autoformat must be re-expressed against the rich surface. |
| Dirty-state and document buffer | `_on_text_changed`, `document.set_text(...)`, [quill/core/document.py](quill/core/document.py) | Medium | The buffer is no longer just a string. The Document model needs a representation that can hold formatting (or a paired markup-plus-format view) without `core` importing `wx`. |
| Selection (expand, shrink, select all) | selection helpers in [quill/ui/main_frame.py](quill/ui/main_frame.py), [quill/core/selection.py](quill/core/selection.py), [quill/core/set_ops.py](quill/core/set_ops.py) | Medium | Offsets differ between a markup string and a formatted run model; selection math must move behind the surface protocol. |
| Clipboard (cut, copy, paste) and context menu | editor context-menu wiring, `_copy_text_to_clipboard`, `copy_with_source`, [quill/platform/windows/clipboard.py](quill/platform/windows/clipboard.py), [quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools.py](quill/ui/main_frame_power_tools.py) | High | Rich paste must decide between formatted paste and paste-as-plain, and copy should offer RTF and plain flavors. This is also a security surface: pasted RTF must be sanitized. |
| Navigation (go to line, bookmarks, headings, outline) | `go_to_line`, `_navigate_heading`, `open_heading_organizer`, bookmark commands, [quill/core/outline.py](quill/core/outline.py), [quill/core/structure_nav.py](quill/core/structure_nav.py) | Medium | Headings are styles in a rich document, not `#` prefixes. Outline and heading navigation must read paragraph styles instead of scanning markup. |
| Find and replace | `find_text`, `_open_find_replace`, replace-all and replace-in-files, [quill/core/search.py](quill/core/search.py), [quill/core/regex_ops.py](quill/core/regex_ops.py) | Medium | Search runs over plain text extracted from the rich model; match offsets map back to formatted runs. Replace must preserve surrounding formatting. |
| Spellcheck | `open_spell_check_dialog`, as-you-type toggle, [quill/core/spellcheck.py](quill/core/spellcheck.py) | Medium | Word extraction and squiggle placement work on runs rather than a flat string; correction must not drop a run's formatting. |
| Markup and formatting commands | `format_bold`, `format_italic`, `format_heading`, heading-level commands, [quill/core/format_ops.py](quill/core/format_ops.py), [quill/core/autoformat.py](quill/core/autoformat.py) | High | On the plain surface these insert characters; on the rich surface they toggle native attributes. This is the clearest case for the surface protocol to own two implementations of one command. |
| Autosave | `_maybe_autosave`, [quill/core/autosave.py](quill/core/autosave.py) | Low | Autosave serializes the document; it needs the rich serializer but the trigger logic is unchanged. |
| Backups and recovery | `restore_backup`, [quill/core/backups.py](quill/core/backups.py), [quill/core/recovery.py](quill/core/recovery.py) | Medium | Backups must store enough to restore formatting; recovery must round-trip the rich representation atomically. |
| Undo and redo, including persistent undo | `undo`, `redo`, persistent-undo load and flush, [quill/core/undo_store.py](quill/core/undo_store.py) | High | The rich control has its own undo stack. Reconciling it with QUILL's persistent, cross-session undo is the subtlest engineering problem in the whole proposal. |
| Word count and statistics | `show_word_count`, [quill/core/metrics.py](quill/core/metrics.py) | Low | Metrics run on extracted plain text. |
| Read-aloud and text-to-speech | read-aloud commands and progress handlers, [quill/core/read_aloud.py](quill/core/read_aloud.py) | Medium | Read-aloud reads plain text; an opportunity is to announce formatting boundaries (entering and leaving bold) as a spoken cue. |
| Dictation | dictation commands and handlers, [quill/core/dictation.py](quill/core/dictation.py), [quill/platform/windows/dictation.py](quill/platform/windows/dictation.py) | Medium | Inserted dictated text must land in the rich model with the caret's current formatting. |

### Cross-cutting impacts beyond individual commands

- Settings and the Preferences hub. A new setting, for example
  `editor_surface` with values `plain` and `rich`, registered in
  [quill/core/settings_registry.py](quill/core/settings_registry.py) and surfaced
  as a category in the new Preferences hub. Switching surfaces should be possible
  per document and as a default.
- The Document model. Today the buffer is text. A rich surface needs a
  representation that carries formatting. The least invasive design keeps markup
  as the canonical text and attaches a formatting overlay, so plain-text features
  keep working on the canonical text and the rich control renders the overlay.
- Security. RTF is a historically dangerous format (object packager and embedded
  object abuse, remote image fetches). Any native RTF surface must parse defensively,
  refuse embedded executables and OLE objects, and honor QUILL's no-silent-network
  rule by never fetching a remote resource referenced in an RTF without explicit
  consent. This aligns with the existing egress-audit posture.
- Testing and CI. Because `wx` cannot be imported on Linux CI, the conversion and
  formatting model must live in `quill/io` with pure unit tests, and the control
  itself must be covered by the existing source-contract testing style plus the
  dialog-inventory and public-surface gates. The wx-freedom of `core` and `io`
  must not regress.
- Performance. The PRD sets latency budgets for the editor. A rich control over a
  large document has different performance characteristics; large-file behavior
  must be measured against the existing performance gates before this ships.

### A staged, honest delivery plan

1. Surface protocol first. Refactor `main_frame` so all editor access goes
   through an editor-surface protocol, with the existing `wx.TextCtrl` as the only
   implementation. No user-visible change. This de-risks everything that follows
   and is independently valuable.
2. Rich model in `quill/io`. Extend the RTF model so a formatted document can be
   represented, converted, and tested without `wx`.
3. Read-only rich preview. Ship a rich *view* of a document before a rich
   *editor*. Lower risk, immediately useful, and it exercises the announcement
   grammar for formatting.
4. Opt-in rich editor. Introduce the `wx.RichTextCtrl` surface behind a feature
   flag and the new setting, defaulting off, with a frank accessibility note in
   the picker.
5. Fidelity and safety polish. Lossy-conversion warnings, sidecar preservation,
   RTF sanitization, and the spoken formatting vocabulary.

### Opening files: the moment the design lives or dies

Everything above is plumbing. The place a writer actually meets this design is the
instant they open a file. If that moment is confusing ("why is this file showing
markup characters?" or "why did my headings turn into hash marks?"), the feature
fails no matter how elegant the internals are. So the open and save experience
deserves its own design, and it can be genuinely magical.

#### The one principle that prevents all confusion

The file chooses the surface, the writer can override, and QUILL always says which
lens you are in. Stated as three promises:

- A file opens in the surface that fits its nature, automatically.
- The writer can flip to the other lens at any time with one command, on a
  per-document basis, without losing a word.
- QUILL announces the active surface on open and on every switch, so a
  screen-reader user is never guessing.

That last promise is the accessibility heart of it. The status bar shows the lens
("Plain" or "Rich"), and the announcement grammar speaks it: "Opened report.rtf,
Rich text lens."

#### How each kind of file behaves on open

There is no separate "open as plain" versus "open as rich" file picker. There is
one Open command. QUILL inspects what you opened and does the obvious right thing,
then tells you what it did.

| You open | Default surface | What QUILL says and offers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A plain text file (`.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, code) | Plain | Opens exactly as today. No change whatsoever for existing users. |
| An `.rtf` file, with the rich surface available | Rich | "Opened in Rich text lens." A single command flips to Plain to see or edit the underlying markup. |
| An `.rtf` file, with the rich surface turned off | Plain (markup) | Behaves like today's EDS-21 round-trip, and offers a one-key "Open in Rich text lens" if the writer wants formatting. |
| A rich format QUILL can import (`.docx`, `.odt`, `.pages`) | Plain by default, Rich if opted in | QUILL says how it imported and whether formatting was simplified, with a link to view details. |
| A non-text file (`.pdf`, image for OCR, spreadsheet) | Plain (extracted text) | Unchanged; these are read or extracted into text and never pretend to be rich documents. |

The key insight: the writer's default-surface preference is a *fallback*, not a
mandate. An `.rtf` is inherently a rich document, so it opens rich when rich is
available, even if the writer's default is plain, because that is the least
surprising thing. The preference only decides the ambiguous cases.

#### Making the choice effortless, not a chore

A few touches turn a potential annoyance into something that feels considerate:

- Remember per file. If you opened `journal.rtf` in Plain last time, QUILL
  reopens it in Plain and says so. The decision is sticky per document, stored in
  the same schema-validated JSON used for other per-document state, so you only
  ever decide once.
- One command to flip lenses. A single QUILL-key command, "Switch editing lens,"
  toggles Plain and Rich for the current document, announces the new lens, and
  keeps the caret on the same word. No dialog, no reload.
- No dead ends. Every flip is reversible and lossless within a session, because
  the canonical markup-plus-overlay model holds both views at once. You can move
  back and forth freely while you decide which you prefer for this file.
- Speak the consequence before a lossy save, never after. If saving the current
  lens to the chosen file type would drop something (for example, saving a richly
  formatted document down to `.txt`), QUILL says exactly what will be flattened and
  offers to keep a sidecar copy in a faithful format. This reuses the no-silent-loss
  promise from the fidelity stage.

#### Saving: the mirror image, equally calm

Saving follows the same "least surprise, always announced" rule.

- Save keeps the file's own format. An `.rtf` saves as RTF, a `.md` saves as
  Markdown, regardless of which lens you were editing in, because the lens is a
  *view*, not the file's identity.
- Save As is where format genuinely changes, and that is the right place for a
  clear, accessible format picker with a spoken fidelity note ("Saving as plain
  text will remove bold, italic, and headings. Keep a Rich copy too?").
- The dirty-state, autosave, and backup machinery all operate on the canonical
  model, so switching lenses never marks a document dirty by itself and never
  risks a recovery that loses formatting.

#### Why this is magical and not just tolerable

The ordinary version of this feature forces a mode decision on the user and then
punishes wrong guesses with lost formatting. The QUILL version removes the
decision in the common cases, makes it one reversible keystroke in the rare cases,
keeps both views of the document alive at once so nothing is ever lost, and speaks
every state and consequence aloud so a blind writer navigates it with exactly the
same confidence as a sighted one. A writer opens their file and it simply looks
right, sounds right, and saves right. That is the magic: the two surfaces feel like
one calm editor that happens to know when to show formatting.

### Recommendation

Pursue it, but as a protocol-first refactor that delivers value at every stage,
and keep the plain-text surface the default and the fully-supported path. The
rich surface should be a celebrated power-user choice, not a replacement, and its
accessibility story should be told honestly at the moment of opt-in. Done this
way, QUILL becomes the rare app that offers live rich editing and still treats
plain-text, screen-reader-first writing as first class. That is the magic: not
catching up to word processors, but giving blind and low-vision writers a rich
surface that finally speaks formatting out loud.

### Illumination: formatting beside a plain-text file (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1)

A plain `.txt` file has nowhere to store fonts, colour, or alignment, so the
hidden-codes model's plain-text writer strips formatting on save (honest
fidelity). For writers who want a *clean* text file that still round-trips their
formatting in QUILL, Beta 2 adds the **Illumination** — named for the decorative
layer a scribe paints over a manuscript: the clean text is the manuscript, the
formatting is its illumination, stored as a companion file.

**Model** (`quill/io/illumination.py`, wx-free). An Illumination is a small JSON
sidecar written next to the document as `<name>.illumination`:

* `version` — schema version.
* `text_sha256` — a hash of the clean (formatting-stripped) text the Illumination
  was built from.
* `document` — the serialized `RichDocument` (clean text plus the full run and
  paragraph attribute structure), captured with `markdown_to_rich` and restored
  with `rich_to_markdown`, so it carries the whole hidden-codes vocabulary
  (font/size/colour/highlight/underline/strike/super-subscript and paragraph
  alignment/spacing/indent/named-style) losslessly.

**Drift safety.** On open, QUILL re-applies the Illumination only when the `.txt`
on disk still hashes to the recorded `text_sha256`. If the file was edited in
another program, the overlay would land on the wrong words, so QUILL declines and
opens the file as plain text instead. This makes the sidecar safe to keep beside
files that travel.

**Policy (configurable).** The `plain_text_with_formatting` setting (Editing
group) governs what happens when a formatted document is saved as plain text:

* `ask` (default) — offer to keep formatting (redirect to Markdown/Word/RTF),
  save plain `.txt` **plus** an Illumination, or save plain and drop formatting.
* `illuminate` — always write the sidecar alongside the clean `.txt`.
* `plain` — save clean and remove any stale sidecar (the classic lossy save).

**Honest limits.** The Illumination is a *separate* file: copy or e-mail only the
`.txt` and the formatting does not travel — the UI and docs say so, and steer
writers who want one self-contained file to Markdown (inline codes) or Word/RTF
(native formatting). The fully out-of-band, clean-on-disk-everywhere variant (no
visible codes even in a saved `.md`) remains the deferred "Option B" end-state in
[`docs/planning/rtf.md`](../planning/rtf.md); Illumination delivers the clean-text
round-trip now without that larger overlay rebuild.

### Spoken Echo: re-read the last announcement (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1)

**Problem.** QUILL speaks a great deal of transient information — indent depth,
formatting at the caret, save and search results, "no matches" — and speech is
gone the instant it is spoken. A screen-reader user who missed or wants to copy a
spoken line had no way to recover it. Screen readers solve this with a "speak,
double-tap to virtualise" convention; QUILL needed an equivalent that fits its
architecture.

**Model** (`quill/core/spoken_echo.py`, wx-free). Every spoken line already flows
through a single choke point in the shell — `_announce` and `_set_status` both
update the status bar and speak. Those two methods now also call `_record_spoken`,
which appends to a bounded history (`SPOKEN_ECHO_LIMIT = 20`) via `record_spoken`,
dropping empty and consecutive-duplicate lines. `format_spoken_echo` renders the
history newest-first for display. Keeping the history and formatting in core makes
them unit-testable without a UI; the `deque` lives on the frame.

**Surfaces.** `view.spoken_echo` ("Show Spoken Echo") opens a read-only,
selectable, copyable dialog (modelled on the QUILL-key help dialog, registered in
the dialog inventory). It is bound to **Alt+Shift+E** in `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` and both
shipped profiles, and appears in the Help menu. This dedicated key is the
**universal** trigger: it works after any announcement, including those produced
by text-editing keys (Tab's indent depth), with no risk to typing.

**Double-press layer.** For the familiar gesture, `_run_command` detects a second
press of the same command within `_ECHO_DOUBLE_PRESS_WINDOW` (0.5 s) and opens the
Echo instead of re-running — but only for a curated set of *informational,
side-effect-free* commands (`_ECHO_DOUBLE_PRESS_COMMANDS`: describe formatting,
document summary, context help, announce contrast), where re-running is harmless.
It is deliberately **not** wired to text-editing keys, and is gated by the
`spoken_echo_on_double_press` setting (default on). Because accelerator-bound
commands dispatch through wx menu events rather than `_run_command`, double-press
currently covers the command-palette and QUILL-key paths; the dedicated key
covers everything. Extending double-press to specific accelerator keys is a
possible later enhancement.

### Keyboard Manager: search, record, conflicts, diagnostics (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1)

**Problem.** The original Keymap Editor was a flat list with a plain text box: you
typed an exact binding string and hoped. There was no way to ask "what is this key
bound to?", conflict detection was a brittle ``.upper()`` string compare that
missed re-ordered spellings (``Shift+Ctrl+K`` vs ``Ctrl+Shift+K``), conflicts were
reported by raw command id, and there was nothing to catch duplicates or
assigned-but-inert keys. The goal was a VSCode-class, screen-reader-first
experience.

**Core grammar** (``quill/core/keymap_query.py``, wx-free). One module owns the
tolerant parse and canonicalisation: ``parse_binding`` accepts alias modifiers
(``control``/``ctrl``/``ctl``, ``option``/``opt``), any modifier order, any case,
named keys, function keys, the QUILL-key chord grammar, and the ``quill`` prefix
alias; it rejects genuine garbage. ``canonical_binding`` collapses an accepted
binding to one deterministic string (modifier order Ctrl, Alt, Shift to match
``DEFAULT_KEYMAP``; macOS ``Cmd`` is a *distinct* token, never folded into Ctrl).
On top sit ``find_keymap_conflicts`` (all owners of a key, canonical-compared),
``commands_for_keystroke`` (reverse lookup for search), ``duplicate_bindings``,
and ``diagnose_keymap`` (duplicates, invalid strings, unknown commands, and
"missing dispatch" — bound but not firable). ``keymap.find_keymap_conflict`` now
delegates here, so ``merge_keymaps`` correctly drops a saved override that
collides with a default under a different spelling.

**Editor** (``quill/ui/keymap_editor.py``, ``KeymapEditorMixin``, extracted from
``main_frame``). A persistent dialog with: a single smart search box (command-name
substring, or — when the text parses as a binding — a reverse lookup with live
"assigned to X / unassigned and available" feedback); a **Record Keys** capture
dialog that turns a pressed chord into a binding string; alias/any-order tolerant
assignment that stores the *canonical* form and refuses keys the dispatch layer
cannot fire (no inert bindings); friendly conflict resolution that names the owning
command by title and offers a one-step reassign (move here, free there); and a
**Diagnostics** report with a conservative **Heal** that removes invalid/orphaned
entries and re-applies the keymap via ``_reload_shortcuts_from_keymap`` (duplicates
and inert keys are reported for manual resolution rather than guessed at).

### Go to Document by position (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1)

With several documents open, cycling Next/Previous (Ctrl+Tab) is slow. **Alt+1**
through **Alt+9**, plus **Alt+0** for the tenth, jump straight to a document by
its position. Ten ``window.go_to_document_N`` commands back a single
``go_to_document(position)`` method (built on the existing ``_select_tab``);
out-of-range positions announce rather than switch. The bindings live in
``DEFAULT_KEYMAP`` (so they flow to every profile and are remappable in the
Keyboard Manager) and are applied through the frame accelerator table via
accelerator-only menu ids. The Window menu's dynamic open-document list shows each
shortcut inline (``&1: Notes (Alt+1)``) for discoverability; ``Alt+digit`` is free
default key-space and, unlike ``Ctrl+Alt+`` chords, is not screen-reader-hostile.

### Braille editor control type (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1; cell-two offset unresolved)

Some braille displays render the first character of every line in cell two for a
rich-text control — the long-standing word-processor quirk. Because QUILL's editor
must be a RichEdit for correct accessible-value reporting (#616, a *read-only*
constraint), **Settings → Accessibility → Editor control type (braille)** lets a
braille user pick the native control: ``rich2`` (RichEdit 3.0, default), ``rich``
(RichEdit 2.0), or ``plain`` (a Notepad-style EDIT control — editable, so it still
reports its value to JAWS/NVDA). It applies at editor construction (new
documents/restart). **Status (2026-07-02): the control-type switch has not
resolved the reported offset — the issue persists on affected displays, and an
outcome is still being considered.** The options are retained deliberately as a
troubleshooting/experimentation surface (users A/B against their own display;
where the offset reproduces in Notepad itself, the cause is the braille display /
screen-reader configuration, e.g. left status cells, not the control), and
shipping docs must not claim the offset is fixed.

### QuillRichEdit: a native Rich Edit wrapper for the cell-two offset and selection-dots investigation (shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2; braille testing pending)

The control-type switch above changes *which* native control QUILL uses but
gives no leverage *inside* the chosen control. **QuillRichEdit**
(`quill/ui/richedit_rtf_surface.py`) is a thin wrapper over the *same*
`RICHEDIT50W` control QUILL already ships as its default editor — same Win32
window class, same `wx.TextCtrl(TE_RICH2 | TE_NOHIDESEL)`, so the full editor
contract (value/caret/selection/undo/events) is inherited unchanged and no
existing surface is affected. What it adds is a controlled handle on the
control's **Text Object Model** (`ITextDocument`/`ITextSelection`, reached via
`EM_GETOLEINTERFACE` → `QueryInterface(ITextDocument)`, no Python ctypes
callback in the hot path — a callback-driven `EM_STREAMIN`/`EM_STREAMOUT`
attempt was tried first and hard-crashes msftedit; see
`docs/planning/editor-surface-experiments.md` §8 for the post-mortem) and its
low-level edit-style messages (`EM_SETEDITSTYLE`/`EM_GETEDITSTYLE`).

Three phases shipped:

- **RTF load/save** through the TOM (`load_rtf`/`save_rtf`/`get_rtf`/`set_rtf`),
  verified end-to-end against a real `RICHEDIT50W` (a bold run round-trips
  through save and reload with no crash) — the first rung toward a
  lightweight, accessible RTF document mode.
- **Formatting on the selection** — bold/italic/underline (toggled via
  `ITextFont` + `tomToggle`), font name/size, and paragraph alignment — all
  through the same TOM, verified on-device (italic, font, size, and center
  all appear correctly in the saved RTF).
- **A braille instrument and a candidate fix for #616/#813.** A read-only
  selection localizer compares the control's own selection
  (`ITextSelection.Start/End`) against wx's `GetSelection`; on-device they
  agree, which localizes #813 (JAWS braille not showing dots 7-8 on a
  selection) to an assistive-technology rendering gap, not a control-tracking
  one. The candidate fix, `set_emulate_system_edit`, applies
  `SES_EMULATESYSEDIT` via `EM_SETEDITSTYLE` — asking the Rich Edit to behave
  like the classic `EDIT` control (which testing showed renders from cell 1
  *and* shows selection dots 7-8) while remaining a genuine Rich Edit, so its
  correct `IAccessible` value reporting (the reason RichEdit is the default in
  the first place, #616) is unchanged.

**Gating (deliberately conservative — this changes the control your whole
document lives in):** QuillRichEdit only exists when *both*
`experimental_acknowledged` and `experimental_editor_surfaces_enabled` are on
and `experimental_editor_surface` is set to `richedit_rtf`; the emulate-sysedit
braille lever is a further, separate checkbox
(`experimental_richedit_emulate_sysedit`) under the same double gate. Every
path falls back to a plain `wx.TextCtrl` on any failure — selecting this
surface can never brick the editor. All three settings are restart-based (new
documents/relaunch), matching every other editor-surface option.

**Status: needs on-device JAWS + braille-display testing.** The instrument and
the lever both verify cleanly by direct `SendMessage`/COM inspection, but
whether the lever actually fixes what a braille display shows — cell start
position, selection dots 7-8, and whether JAWS still reads the editor's value
correctly — can only be judged on real hardware. See the request for braille
display owner feedback in the user guide's Experimental Features section, and
`docs/planning/editor-surface-experiments.md` §8 for the full test protocol
and the running record of results.

### The Fragment spine, and five features built on it (shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

`quill/core/fragment.py` introduces one small object, `Fragment` (`markup`,
`title`, `source`, `source_url`, `kind`, `created_at`), and one pure function,
`render_fragment(frag, fmt)`, rendering it as `TEXT` (via the existing
`io.export.markdown_to_plain_text`), `MARKDOWN` (verbatim), or `HTML` (via
`browser_preview.render_preview_body`). A new setting, `content_handoff_format`
(Preferences > Editing > "Kept and sent content format"; text/markdown/html),
is the one format choice every consumer below reads, so "interchangeable" is
true in practice, not just in name.

- **#897 — Wikipedia in Look Up.** `WikipediaProvider` (`quill/core/lexical.py`)
  is a new keyless online `LexicalProvider`, in the same shape as
  `FreeDictionaryProvider`/`DatamuseProvider`: same consented-online-lookup
  gate, same HTTPS+verified-TLS `_http_get_json` helper (the existing
  `network_egress_audit.py` entry for `core/lexical.py` already covers it).
  `LexicalResult.encyclopedia` carries the summary; a disambiguation page or a
  missing extract normalizes to no entry (a summary, not a list to sort
  through). `show_lookup_dialog` is driven entirely by `render_lookup`/
  `build_lookup_items`, both pure, so the new Encyclopedia section needed no
  UI changes at all.
- **#895 — Clip Library.** `ClipLibrary`/`ClipEntry` (`quill/core/clip_library.py`)
  is a 200-entry ring buffer of Fragments, de-duplicated by
  `(markup, source)`, with favorites protected from eviction and
  `promote_to_tray(index, tray, slot)` as the bridge into a specific Copy Tray
  slot — Copy Tray itself is untouched. `ClipLibraryDialog` (search, favorite,
  remove, copy, promote) and `ClipLibraryMixin` (`keep_selection_in_clip_library`,
  `open_clip_library`) follow the Copy Tray dialog/mixin shape exactly.
  `clip_library_autocapture` (bool, default off) binds `wx.EVT_TEXT_COPY` —
  the native control's own copy notification, so it fires for any trigger
  (menu, shortcut, right-click) without guessing at individual call sites —
  to remember every copy automatically when turned on; the handler always
  calls `event.Skip()` so the native copy is never affected. Deferred:
  non-text clips (images/files as described objects); `Fragment.kind` already
  has a slot for when that becomes real work.
- **#900 — Send as Email / Copy as Email Body.** `build_mailto(frag, fmt, subject)`
  (`quill/core/email_handoff.py`) renders a Fragment and percent-encodes it
  into a `mailto:` URL. File > Send as Email opens it via `webbrowser.open`
  (the same mechanism `run_target_at_cursor` already uses for an in-document
  mailto: link); File > Copy as Email Body renders the same content onto the
  clipboard instead, for mail clients that truncate or reject a long
  `mailto:` body. Both act on the current selection, or the whole document
  when nothing is selected.
- **#894 — Accessible AutoOutline.** `apply_auto_outline`/`remove_outline_numbers`
  (`quill/core/auto_outline.py`) number every Markdown heading by nesting
  level — numeric (1, 1.1, 1.1.1) or legal (I, A, 1; `auto_outline_style`
  setting) — as literal text inserted into the heading line itself, built on
  the existing `markdown_sections.parse_heading_blocks` (so fenced code
  blocks are correctly skipped). Idempotent: an existing AutoOutline number
  is stripped before renumbering, so re-running after adding/removing/
  reordering headings replaces rather than stacks, and switching styles
  replaces rather than appends. Format > Update/Remove Outline Numbering are
  on-demand commands, deliberately not a live continuously-active mode —
  rewriting the whole document on every keystroke would risk fighting typing
  and undo in a screen-reader-first editor.
- **#896 — Work Personas.** `WorkPersona`/`WorkPersonaStore`
  (`quill/core/work_persona.py`) is a named bundle: a feature profile id, a
  working folder, favorite files, and an optional keymap profile.
  `WorkPersonaMixin.apply_persona` (`quill/ui/main_frame_work_persona.py`)
  switches the feature profile (`self.features.switch_profile`), `os.chdir`s
  into the working folder, applies the keymap (`save_keymap` +
  `load_keymap_profile`, effective next restart), and opens every favorite
  file that still exists — each step independently guarded so one stale
  piece never blocks the rest. `quill/core/persona_launcher.py` builds the
  right launch argv (frozen `quill.exe` vs. `python -m quill` from source)
  and can write a real Windows `.lnk` via `pywin32`'s `WScript.Shell` COM
  object, falling back to an equivalent `.bat` launcher on any failure —
  never raising, so a persona always ends up with some double-clickable
  launcher. `--persona NAME` on the command line applies a saved persona
  right after `MainFrame` construction. Non-goals (per the issue): no
  multi-user/access-control, and personas *use* Story Studio/Notebooks/Copy
  Tray rather than replacing them.

### Mandatory alt text at insertion, and inline image descriptions (#899, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

GLOW (`quill/core/glow.py`) already audits missing alt text, auto-fixes it,
and can generate it via opt-in cloud AI — an accessible image object model
already existed, but only as an after-the-fact repair pass. #899 asked for
the proactive half: a document should not be able to *accrue* an
un-alt-texted image in the first place, and a screen reader should announce
when one is missing *as the caret passes it*, not just when an audit is run.

`quill/core/inline_image_alt.py` is the pure core: `image_at_position(text, pos)`
finds the Markdown (`![alt](src)`) or HTML (`<img src=... alt=...>`) image
reference the caret is inside or touching — the same two patterns
`link_inventory.py` already parses for GLOW's audit — and `describe_image(record)`
renders "Image: {filename}, alt text: {alt}" or, just as loudly, "Image:
{filename}, alt text MISSING". `build_image_markdown(path, alt, decorative=)`
builds the Markdown for a newly inserted image; a *decorative* image (the
correct accessible pattern for one with no informational content) gets
deliberately empty alt text, distinct from an image nobody ever described.

`InsertImageDialog` (`quill/ui/insert_image_dialog.py`) is QUILL's first
dedicated image-insertion flow (**Insert > Image...**): a file picker, an alt
text field, and a "this image is decorative" checkbox that disables the alt
text field when checked. Insert is refused — with a status message, not a
silent no-op — unless real alt text is present or decorative is explicitly
checked. `ImageAltMixin` (`quill/ui/main_frame_image_alt.py`) wires this plus
**Tools > Describe Image at Cursor**, which answers the "what does this image
say" question for any image already in the document, however it got there
(typed by hand, pasted, imported).

Deliberately out of scope for this pass: non-image embeds (page breaks,
equations, removed objects) as accessible placeholders. add.md's own spike
note said to investigate a shared placeholder model before designing one —
this covers the object model that already exists (images), not a new one.

### Print Studio: accessible preview, odd/even/reverse/skip-first-page (#891, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

Real print plumbing already existed -- `_print_data` (`wx.PrintData`), a Page
Setup item on `wx.PageSetupDialogData`, and `print_document()` driving
`wx.Printer`. Two things were missing: any preview surface at all, and any
odd/even/reverse/different-first-page options. The existing printout was
also single-page-only (`HasPage` always `page == 1`) -- it drew whatever fit
on one page and silently dropped the rest of the document.

`quill/core/print_pagination.py` is the pure core: `paginate_lines(lines,
lines_per_page)` splits a document into pages; `select_pages(page_count,
page_set=, reverse=, skip_first_page=)` turns a page count and the chosen
options into the concrete, ordered list of page numbers to print --
`skip_first_page` is computed on the *original* page numbers before
odd/even filtering, so "odd pages, skip first" on a 7-page document is
3/5/7, not 1/3/5. `paper_name`/`margins_text`/`describe_preview` build the
spoken/textual preview -- "3 pages, Letter, default margins" -- explicitly
not a WYSIWYG renderer (the issue's own non-goal).

`quill/ui/main_frame_print.py` (`PrintMixin`, extracted from `main_frame.py`
along with the pre-existing `page_setup`/`print_document` to stay within
GATE-11): `_compute_print_preview` uses a throwaway `wx.PrinterDC` for
realistic font-metric-based pagination without starting an actual print
job -- the same DC type the real job prints through, so Print Studio's page
count matches what actually prints. The inner `wx.Printout` in
`_build_text_printout` now paginates for real inside `OnPreparePrinting`
(where wx attaches a live DC) and maps a requested page-set through an
index indirection: wx is told there are `len(selected_pages)` "pages," and
each `OnPrintPage(n)` resolves `n` back to the real document page it
represents. This is the standard technique for custom page ordering in
wx's printing API, which has no native odd/even/reverse concept of its own.

**File > Print Studio...** shows the preview and options, then hands off to
the identical `wx.Printer` flow **File > Print** already uses -- Print
Studio is a step in front of the existing dialog, not a replacement for
it. Header/footer authoring stays explicitly out of scope; that is #892.

### Keyboard-first Header/Footer Builder (#892, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

No header/footer authoring existed at all beyond `wx.PageSetupDialogData`
margins (which has no header/footer concept of its own). Per the issue's
own framing, this is deliberately **named presets over a small, fixed
token set** -- not a blank canvas, and not a general macro/field-code
system.

`quill/core/header_footer.py` (pure): `HeaderFooterSpec` holds six zones
(header/footer × left/center/right), an optional different-first-page set
of six more, a page-number style (`arabic`/`roman`), and a start page
number. Each zone is a template string using `{title}`/`{filename}`/
`{date}`/`{page}` tokens or literal text, rendered by `render_zone`. Four
named presets cover the issue's own examples directly: "Title left, page
number right," "Filename and date," "Roman numerals for front matter,"
and "Blank."

`quill/core/header_footer_store.py` persists a spec as **document
metadata** -- keyed by the document's normalized path, the same
`DocumentMemory.key_for` shape `core/bookmarks.py` already uses -- so it
is part of the document's identity and survives save/reload; an unsaved
document is simply never persisted.

`quill/ui/header_footer_dialog.py` is the keyboard-first builder: a preset
picker fills the six main zones, each independently editable from there; a
"different first page" checkbox enables its own six fields; page-number
style and start-number controls sit below. **File > Header and Footer...**
(`quill/ui/main_frame_print.py`, extending #891's `PrintMixin`) opens it
for the current document.

Both **File > Print** and **File > Print Studio...** now draw the saved
header/footer on every printed page -- the displayed page number accounts
for `start_page_number` and whichever page-set Print Studio's odd/even/
reverse/skip-first-page filtering selected, and a different first page
applies correctly to the document's actual first page, not the first page
of a filtered print run.

**Deliberately out of scope for this pass, per the issue's own build
order:** DOCX/RTF native header/footer XML export. The issue's own text
says to confirm that round-trip before committing further, once real
usage exists to validate against -- this ships the authoring + print-drawn
half first.

### Platform-aware keymap profiles and macOS Preferences placement (shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

The built-in keymap profiles now defer to the platform-aware defaults for
quit, back/forward navigation, and document switching rather than forcing
Windows-style overrides into the shipped profile JSON. This keeps macOS users
on the correct Cmd-based shortcuts while leaving Windows and other platforms
unchanged. The Preferences command also uses the stock macOS app-menu id so it
appears in the standard Quill app-menu location on macOS. The same pass also
routes macOS file-open, folder-reveal, installer-launch, and voice-preview
playback through native macOS launch behavior instead of Windows-only
`os.startfile` assumptions.

### PDF/Office text extraction unbundled to an on-demand download (#909 refinement, shipped 0.9.0 Beta 2)

#909's original bug: `markitdown`/`pdfplumber`/`pypdf` (the free-first Tier-1
Office+PDF text extractor, `quill/io/docconvert.py` + `quill/io/pdf.py`)
lived nowhere the shipping build actually installed — not a base
dependency, not in the extra a clean install pulled — so a fresh install
had no PDF/Office text extractor at all. The fix that shipped first made
them a base runtime dependency (present on every install, whether or not
that install ever opens a PDF). This refines that to the more honest fix:
the three packages move to a named pyproject extra (`pdf-ocr`) and become a
one-click download via **Help > Download Optional Components > "PDF and
Office text extraction"** (~30 MB) — matching how every other optional
QUILL component (Kokoro, whisper.cpp, Pandoc, the braille pack, mpv)
already works, and keeping the minimal-install footprint small for
installs that never touch a PDF or Office document.

`quill/core/pdf_ocr_install.py` is the on-demand installer, modeled
directly on `speech/engine_install.py`'s MP3-support pack: wheel-only
`pip install --target <app data>/engine-packs/pdf-ocr`, Safe Mode gated,
activated on `sys.path` at startup (`activate_pdf_ocr_pack`, called from
`__main__.py` alongside the speech-engine and AI-SDK pack activations). No
import-safety changes were needed anywhere in `quill/` — every existing
call site (`quill/io/pdf.py`, `markitdown_bridge.py`, `structured.py`,
`pages.py`, `docconvert.py`, `action_builder_dialog.py`) already imports
these three packages lazily inside a `try`/`except`, so "these packages
might not be installed" was already a handled case; only the four stale
"pip install ..." remedy messages needed updating to point at Download
Optional Components instead.

`tests/unit/test_packaging_dependencies.py`'s #909 guard now asserts the
opposite of its original claim (not a base dependency) plus two new
invariants: the packages are named in exactly one place (the `pdf-ocr`
extra), and the installer's own pinned requirements are kept in sync with
that extra — evolving the regression coverage rather than deleting it
outright when the fix's shape changed.

### Self-voice fallback is logged, not announced (shipped 0.8.1 Beta 1)

QUILL's SAPI 5 self-voice (``sapi5.py``/``prism_bridge``) is a *fallback* used only
when no screen reader is present; announcements otherwise route to the reader via
Prism / accessible_output2. A SAPI init failure was being *spoken* on startup with
an alarming, mis-worded prompt even while a reader was handling speech.
``_check_tts_fallback_on_startup`` now always records a quiet diagnostic note and
only *speaks* — with the correct **Tools → Retry TTS Engine** path — when
``_screen_reader_handling_speech()`` is false (no SR backend and none detected),
i.e. when the user genuinely has no voice. Separately, comtypes' generated-wrapper
cache is redirected to a writable per-user dir so SAPI initialises under a
read-only install, and screen-reader detection enumerates processes through the
Windows Toolhelp API (ctypes) rather than spawning ``tasklist``, so it never
creates a console window a screen reader or braille display would announce.

## Part Two: Competitive Study, Ulysses

### Why Ulysses is the right mirror for QUILL

Ulysses is a mature, respected, markup-first writing app for Mac, iPad, and
iPhone, in active development since 2003 and an Apple Design Award winner. Like
QUILL, it bets on markup rather than visual rich editing, keeps the writer's
hands on the keyboard, and produces clean text as output. That shared philosophy
makes it the most instructive comparison: where Ulysses is strong, it validates
QUILL's direction; where QUILL is strong, it shows QUILL's distinct advantage.

The comparison below reflects Ulysses as described on its official site and
feature pages.

### Side-by-side at a glance

| Dimension | Ulysses | QUILL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core philosophy | Markup-first, distraction-free, keyboard-driven | Markup-first, screen-reader-first, keyboard-driven |
| Platforms | Mac, iPad, iPhone (Apple only) | Windows first, with a macOS path |
| Accessibility stance | General Apple platform accessibility | Accessibility is the product thesis: NVDA, JAWS, Narrator parity |
| Library and organization | Unified library, groups, filters, keywords | Tabs, profiles, bookmarks, headings outline, quick navigation |
| Writing goals | Deadlines, daily goals, character and word targets | Word count and statistics |
| Proofreading | Built-in grammar and style check, 20-plus languages | Spellcheck, with AI assistance as explicit opt-in |
| Export and publishing | PDF, Word, ebook, plus WordPress, Ghost, Medium, Micro.blog | Pandoc-backed multi-format export and conversion |
| Sync | Seamless first-party cloud sync across Apple devices | Local-first storage, privacy-first |
| Privacy posture | Cloud library by design | No silent network calls, explicit consent per action |
| AI | Limited | Opt-in assistant, branchable sessions, local-first options |

### What Ulysses does that QUILL can learn from

These are the ideas worth bringing into QUILL, each reframed through QUILL's
accessibility-first, privacy-first, plain-text-first lens so it arrives as a QUILL
feature rather than a transplant.

#### Writing goals you can hear

Ulysses lets a writer set a deadline and a daily or per-document target and watch
progress fill toward it. QUILL has word count and statistics but not goals as a
first-class, motivating object. The magical QUILL version is a *spoken,
glanceable* goal: set a target by voice or command, and QUILL announces progress
on demand and at milestones ("halfway to your 800 words", "goal met") through the
existing announcement grammar, with an optional status-bar field. This turns a
visual progress bar into something a blind writer experiences exactly as richly as
a sighted one.

#### Keywords as a navigation and filtering layer

Ulysses attaches keywords to sheets and filters the library by them. QUILL has
headings, bookmarks, and profiles, but not lightweight, user-defined tags that cut
across documents. A QUILL keyword system, stored in schema-validated JSON and fully
keyboard and screen-reader navigable, would let a writer mark passages or files
("research", "todo", "chapter-3") and then jump or filter by tag through the quick
navigation surface. The magic is making tags audible and command-driven rather
than a mouse-driven sidebar.

#### A unified, navigable library

Ulysses keeps every text in one searchable library that syncs everywhere. QUILL is
file-and-tab oriented. Without abandoning local-first files, QUILL could offer an
optional library *view*: a single accessible list or tree across a writer's
project folders, with type-ahead, keywords, and goals visible, built from the same
stock-control, first-letter-navigable patterns QUILL already favors. It is the
Edge-style list pattern QUILL just adopted for Preferences, applied to a writer's
whole corpus.

#### Built-in style and grammar assistance, on QUILL's terms

Ulysses ships an integrated proofreader across many languages. QUILL has
spellcheck and an opt-in AI assistant. The recommendation is not to bolt on a
cloud grammar service; it is to make style and grammar suggestions a *local-first,
consent-gated* capability that announces each suggestion and never sends text
anywhere without explicit per-action consent, consistent with QUILL's egress rules.
Ulysses proves writers want this; QUILL can offer it without surrendering privacy.

#### Frictionless, beautiful export with live preview

Ulysses turns text into polished PDF, Word, and ebooks with on-the-fly style
switching and live preview. QUILL already has strong Pandoc-backed export. The
borrowable idea is the *experience*: a single command that previews the chosen
output format and lets the writer switch styles before exporting, with the preview
itself accessible. QUILL's advantage is that its preview can be screen-reader
legible, which a purely visual preview is not.

#### Distraction-free focus as an announced mode

Ulysses is built around a calm, distraction-free interface. QUILL can offer a
focus mode that does more than hide chrome: it can announce entry and exit, mute
non-essential notifications, and optionally narrow read-aloud to the current
paragraph, making focus a multi-sensory state rather than a visual one.

### What QUILL should deliberately not copy

- Apple-only reach. Ulysses is Apple-exclusive. QUILL's Windows-first,
  screen-reader-first mission is its differentiation; that should not change to
  chase Ulysses' aesthetic.
- Cloud-library-by-default. Ulysses assumes a synced cloud library. QUILL's
  local-first, no-silent-network posture is a feature, not a gap. Any library or
  sync work must stay opt-in and consent-gated.
- Subscription-shaped feature gating. Pricing strategy is out of scope here, but
  QUILL should not let a feature's design be distorted by a paywall the way some
  Ulysses capabilities are.

### Where QUILL already beats Ulysses

It is worth naming QUILL's lead so the roadmap protects it.

- Screen-reader-first design. Ulysses inherits platform accessibility; QUILL is
  engineered around it, with a shared announcement grammar and parity across NVDA,
  JAWS, and Narrator.
- Privacy by architecture. No silent network calls and explicit per-action
  consent are guarantees Ulysses does not make.
- Branchable AI writing sessions. QUILL's resumable, forkable session tree is a
  genuinely novel capability with no Ulysses equivalent.
- Windows reach. QUILL serves a platform and an audience Ulysses does not.

### Recommended priorities from this study

In rough order of value-to-effort for QUILL's audience:

1. Spoken writing goals, building on the existing metrics and announcement
   surfaces. High value, modest effort, distinctly QUILL.
2. Keyword tags with audible navigation and filtering, reusing the quick
   navigation and schema-validated JSON storage patterns.
3. An optional accessible library view across project folders, reusing the
   first-letter-navigable list pattern.
4. Consent-gated, local-first style and grammar suggestions that announce each
   finding.
5. An accessible export preview with on-the-fly style switching.
6. An announced, multi-sensory focus mode.

Each of these takes a proven Ulysses idea and re-expresses it as something a blind
or low-vision writer experiences fully, which is exactly the territory where QUILL
should aim to be not just competitive but singular.

## Part Three: Compose Mode, a Workshop for Assembling Documents

### The idea in one sentence

Add an optional Compose mode where a document is built from a list of parts (call
them segments, QUILL's answer to Ulysses sheets), each part holding a chunk of
writing or a pulled-in source, where the writer reorders parts, promotes and
demotes their heading levels, and merges them into one finished document, while a
live HTML preview shows the assembled whole in real time, and the parts can be
written in Markdown, RTF, or HTML.

This is the writing-as-architecture idea that David Hewson praised in Ulysses
("shuffle around the many different parts and scenes"), rebuilt so a screen-reader
user can architect a document by ear with exactly the same fluency as by eye.

### What a writer actually does in Compose mode

Picture a long piece: a report, a thesis chapter, a book section. Instead of one
unbroken file, the writer sees an accessible list of parts:

- Introduction
- Background (pulled from `research-notes.md`)
- Method
- A quoted source (pulled from an `.rtf` a colleague sent)
- Findings
- Conclusion

Each part is a real, editable unit. The writer can:

- Reorder parts. Move "Method" above "Background" and the whole document
  reflows, the preview updates, and QUILL announces "Moved Method to position 3 of
  6."
- Re-level headings. Promote a part so its heading becomes a top-level section,
  or demote it so it nests under the part above. QUILL announces "Background is
  now heading level 2, nested under Introduction."
- Pull sources together. Add a part that references another file (Markdown, RTF,
  or HTML) so material from many places is gathered into one outline without
  copy-paste drift. The source can be embedded (frozen copy) or linked (kept in
  sync), and QUILL says which.
- Mix formats per part. One part can be Markdown, the next RTF, the next HTML.
  Compose mode normalizes them through QUILL's existing conversion layer so the
  assembled document is coherent.
- Merge to a single document. When the architecture is right, "Flatten to
  document" produces one ordinary file in the writer's chosen format, with heading
  levels already correct.

### The structure tree: the document as a navigable outline

A flat list of parts is good; a tree is magical, and it is the natural fit for
QUILL because the codebase already proves the pattern. QUILL ships an accessible
tree-navigator (`_NavigatorNode` and `_show_tree_navigator` in
[quill/ui/main_frame.py](quill/ui/main_frame.py)) used today for the heading
outline, EPUB chapters, and the misspelling list, and a tree-based *structure
editor* (the YAML editor) that already performs add-child, add-sibling, rename,
and delete on a `wx.TreeCtrl` with a live preview beside it. Compose mode should
reuse this exact, battle-tested pattern rather than invent a new surface.

Represented as a tree, the part list becomes the document's true shape:

- Introduction
- Method
  - Participants
  - Materials
- Background
- Findings
  - Quantitative
  - Quoted source (from a colleague's RTF)
- Conclusion

A `wx.TreeCtrl` is a first-class accessible control (it sits in the dialog
contract's preferred-focus list), and on Windows, macOS, and Linux it gives blind
writers what sighted writers get from an indented outline: nesting they can feel.

- Arrow keys walk the structure. Up and down move between parts, right expands a
  part to hear its children, left collapses to hear just the section. Screen
  readers announce level and position natively ("Method, level 1, expanded, 2 of
  6; Participants, level 2, 1 of 2").
- Collapsing a branch hides a whole sub-section so a writer can think at the
  chapter level, then expand to drop into detail, the outliner's core joy.
- The tree is the document. Reordering a node reorders the prose; promoting a node
  re-levels its heading; moving a parent carries its children. There is no
  separate outline to drift out of sync.
- Each node speaks its essentials on focus: title, heading level, child count,
  word count, format (Markdown, RTF, or HTML), and link-or-embedded state, all in
  the shared announcement grammar.

The rich context menu described next hangs directly off this tree, and the live
HTML preview sits beside it exactly as the YAML editor places a preview beside its
structure tree, so moving a node and hearing the reflowed result is one gesture.

### The live HTML preview, made accessible

A real-time HTML preview is the visual half of the magic. The accessible half is
making that preview meaningful without sight.

- The preview renders the assembled document as HTML and updates as parts move or
  change, reusing QUILL's existing HTML preview path.
- Crucially, the preview is screen-reader legible: it is presented as structured,
  navigable text (headings, lists, links exposed as real semantics), not as an
  opaque image of a page, so a screen-reader user can read the assembled result by
  heading and by element just like the final document.
- A spoken structure summary is one keystroke away: "6 parts, 4 top-level
  headings, estimated 2,300 words, reading order: Introduction, Method,
  Background..." so the writer hears the shape of the whole before diving in.
- Preview and parts stay in sync both ways: jumping to a heading in the preview
  offers to jump to the part that produced it, closing the loop between the
  architecture view and the reading view.

### Why this is delightful, not just powerful

- Nothing is lost while you experiment. Reordering and re-leveling operate on the
  part list, never by destructively cutting and pasting text, so every arrangement
  is reversible and the writer can try three structures in a minute.
- The outline is the document. There is no separate, drifting outline pane to
  maintain; the part list *is* the outline, and editing the outline edits the
  document.
- It speaks architecture. Every structural action has a spoken outcome in the
  shared announcement grammar, so "move this section earlier" is a confident,
  audible act rather than a fragile drag.
- It meets writers where their material is. Markdown notes, an RTF from a
  colleague, an HTML snippet from the web can all become parts without first being
  converted by hand.

### The right-click that builds a document: a rich, spoken context menu

Reordering and re-leveling should not require remembering commands. The fastest,
most direct way to architect a document is to act on the part you are standing on,
and the context menu is where that lives. In Compose mode, invoking the context
menu on a part (by right-click, by the keyboard context-menu key, or by QUILL's
own context command) opens a structure menu that is the command center for the
whole assembly. Every item is keyboard reachable, every item announces its
outcome, and destructive items confirm.

The menu is organized so the most common architectural moves are at the top:

| Menu item | What it does | What QUILL announces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move Up / Move Down | Swaps this part with its neighbor | "Moved Method up to position 2 of 6." |
| Move to Top / Move to Bottom | Jumps this part to the start or end | "Moved Conclusion to the end, position 6 of 6." |
| Move to Position... | Accessible entry to type or pick an exact slot | "Moved Background to position 3 of 6." |
| Promote (heading level up) | Raises this part's heading one level, outdenting it | "Background is now heading level 1, a top-level section." |
| Demote (heading level down) | Lowers this part's heading one level, nesting it | "Background is now heading level 3, nested under Method." |
| Make Top-Level Section | Sets this part to heading level 1 in one step | "Introduction is now a top-level section." |
| Group Under Previous | Nests this part (and re-levels it) beneath the part above | "Grouped Findings under Method." |
| Promote With Children / Demote With Children | Re-levels this part and everything nested under it together | "Promoted Method and its 3 sub-parts." |
| Change Format... | Switches this part between Markdown, RTF, and HTML | "Changed Background to HTML." |
| Convert Link to Embedded Copy | Freezes a linked source so it stops tracking the original | "Background is now an embedded copy." |
| Refresh Linked Source | Re-pulls a linked source's latest content | "Refreshed Background from research-notes.md." |
| Split Part Here / Merge With Previous | Breaks one part into two at the caret, or fuses two | "Split into Method and Method, part 2." |
| Duplicate Part | Copies the part as a new sibling | "Duplicated Findings." |
| Rename Part | Accessible text entry for the part's outline label | "Renamed to Literature Review." |
| Add Keyword to Part... | Tags this part (see Part Four) | "Added keyword research to this part." |
| Preview This Part | Jumps the live HTML preview to this part | "Previewing Findings." |
| Flatten From Here... | Merges this part and those after it into a document | spoken summary of the flattened result |
| Remove Part | Deletes the part (with confirm) | "Removed Background. 5 parts remain." |

#### What makes this context menu magical rather than ordinary

- It speaks position and consequence, always. Every move and re-level reports the
  new position out of the total and the resulting heading relationship, so a
  screen-reader user never has to re-read the list to discover what happened. The
  menu is a place where you act and immediately *hear* the new shape.
- It re-levels structurally, not cosmetically. Promote and Demote understand
  nesting: "Promote With Children" lifts an entire subtree so a writer can move a
  whole sub-section up a level in one act, and QUILL announces how many parts moved
  with it. This is the difference between editing an outline and merely nudging
  text.
- It is context-aware. Items that cannot apply are absent or clearly disabled with
  a spoken reason: "Move Up unavailable, Introduction is already first." "Refresh
  Linked Source unavailable, this part is an embedded copy." No dead clicks, no
  silent no-ops.
- It mirrors keyboard commands exactly. Every menu item has a QUILL-key binding so
  power users never need the menu, and the menu never hides a capability the
  keyboard lacks. The context menu and the command system are two doors to one
  room.
- It keeps focus sane. After a move, focus stays on the part that moved (now in its
  new position) so repeated presses of "Move Up" walk a part smoothly toward the
  top, each step announced, exactly the predictable behavior the repository's
  dialog and focus rules require.
- It confirms only what is destructive. Reordering and re-leveling are instantly
  reversible and never prompt; Remove Part and a flatten that would overwrite a
  file confirm through a native accessible dialog. Friction lands only where loss
  is possible.

#### Beyond the single part: acting on a selection

The magic compounds when the writer selects several parts in the list. The same
context menu then operates on the whole set, spoken as a set: "Move 3 parts up,"
"Demote 3 parts," "Group 3 parts under Introduction," "Add keyword research to 3
parts." A scattered draft becomes a structured manuscript in a handful of audible,
reversible gestures, all from the one context menu every editor estate already
makes feel familiar.

This context menu must, like all QUILL dialogs and menus, be registered and
classified under the DLG-3 dialog and menu estate, with no menu items mutated while
the menu is open (deferring label and enable updates until close), per the
repository's dialog and menu lessons.

### How Compose mode fits QUILL's architecture

This respects the same boundaries as the rest of this document.

- The part-list model, reordering, heading-level math, and the flatten-to-document
  logic are pure and live in `quill/core` and `quill/io`, free of `wx` and fully
  unit-testable on Linux CI. They build directly on the existing outline, heading,
  and conversion modules ([quill/core/outline.py](quill/core/outline.py),
  [quill/core/heading_styles.py](quill/core/heading_styles.py),
  [quill/io/pandoc.py](quill/io/pandoc.py), and the RTF and HTML io paths).
- The Compose surface itself (the accessible part list, the editor for the
  selected part, and the live preview) lives in `quill/ui`, built from stock,
  first-letter-navigable list controls, the same patterns QUILL already favors.
- It honors FeatureManager as an opt-in mode, the dialog-inventory gate for any
  new dialogs, and the no-silent-network rule for any linked remote source.
- A composition is persisted as schema-validated JSON (the ordered part list with
  each part's source, format, embed-or-link choice, and heading level), with atomic
  writes and backup or recovery parity, so an assembly is as robust as any other
  QUILL document.

### Honest constraints

- Mixed-format flattening is only as faithful as the conversions beneath it; the
  same no-silent-loss warnings from Part One apply when a part's formatting cannot
  survive the chosen output format.
- A real-time preview of a large multi-part document must respect QUILL's
  performance budgets; the preview should update incrementally rather than
  re-rendering the world on every keystroke.
- Linked (live) sources introduce freshness and trust questions; linked external
  content must follow the existing untrusted-location and egress-consent rules.

## Part Four: Accessible Keywords for Screen-Reader Users

Keywords (tags) recur through this document as a borrowed Ulysses strength. They
are only worth building if they are fully usable by ear, so they deserve their own
design. The goal: tagging and tag-navigation that a screen-reader user performs as
fluently as a sighted user clicks a colored label.

### What a keyword is in QUILL

A keyword is a short, user-defined label ("research", "todo", "chapter-3",
"verify") attached to a whole document or to a specific part or passage. Keywords
are stored in schema-validated JSON alongside other per-document state, never
embedded invisibly in the prose, so they never pollute the text a screen reader
reads.

### Assigning keywords by ear

- A single command, "Add keyword," opens an accessible entry with type-ahead over
  existing keywords, so the writer reuses "research" rather than inventing
  "reserach". The field announces matches as they narrow.
- Assigning announces the outcome: "Added keyword research to this section. This
  section now has two keywords: research, verify." The writer always hears the
  resulting state, not just the action.
- Removing is symmetric and equally spoken: "Removed todo. One keyword remains:
  research."
- Keywords on a passage are anchored to that passage's position, and QUILL speaks
  where they live ("keyword verify spans the selected sentence") so they are never
  invisible floating state.

### Hearing which keywords are present

The hardest part of tags for a screen-reader user is usually discovery: sighted
users see colored chips at a glance. QUILL replaces the glance with sound and
structure.

- On entering a tagged document or part, QUILL can announce its keywords as part
  of the context, configurably, for example "Findings, keywords: research,
  verify."
- A "Read keywords here" command speaks the keywords at the caret on demand,
  so the information is available the instant it is wanted and silent when it is
  not.
- A status-bar field can carry the current location's keyword count, and reading
  that field aloud is already a supported QUILL action.

### Navigating by keyword

This is where keywords become a navigation superpower rather than mere labels.

- "Go to keyword" opens an accessible, first-letter-navigable list of all
  keywords with their occurrence counts ("research, 7; todo, 3; verify, 2").
  Choosing one lists every place it appears, each entry spoken with its document,
  section, and a short context snippet.
- "Next keyword" and "Previous keyword" jump between occurrences of a chosen tag
  the way heading navigation jumps between headings, each landing announced with
  its surrounding context.
- A keyword filter can scope the accessible library view and Compose mode part
  list to just the tagged items ("showing 7 parts tagged research"), turning a
  sprawling project into a focused working set, entirely by keyboard and entirely
  spoken.

### Why this is the accessible version Ulysses never built

Ulysses keywords are fundamentally visual: chips you scan and click. QUILL's
keywords are spoken objects you can add, hear, filter, and jump through without
ever seeing them. Every keyword action has an audible outcome, every keyword
location is announced rather than implied, and discovery is a command away instead
of a visual scan. That is the through-line of this entire document applied once
more: take a feature the industry built for the eye and make QUILL the place where
it finally speaks.

## Part Five: Embedded Grammar Checking, and How It Understands Language

Grammar checking is the most technically ambitious idea in this document, and the
honest framing matters: spelling asks "is this token a word?" while grammar asks
"is this sentence well-formed, and why?" The second question requires the software
to understand the *structure* of language, not just a wordlist. This part explains
how QUILL would gain that understanding, how it would surface findings through the
same accessible machinery QUILL already uses for spelling, and where the real
complexity and the honest limits lie.

### Spelling is the proven template to build on

QUILL already has the right shape. [quill/core/spellcheck.py](quill/core/spellcheck.py)
is a pure, `wx`-free pipeline: `list_misspellings` returns typed `Misspelling`
records with `start` and `end` offsets, `next_misspelling` and
`previous_misspelling` walk them efficiently from the caret, `misspelling_at_position`
identifies the issue under the cursor, and `suggest_words` offers fixes. The UI
layer turns those records into navigation, a context menu, and the misspelling tree
navigator. Grammar checking should mirror this contract exactly: a pure core engine
that returns typed issue records with offsets, a category, an explanation, and
suggested rewrites, and a UI that reuses QUILL's existing navigation, dialog, and
announcement surfaces. If grammar issues look like richer misspellings to the rest
of the app, the integration cost collapses.

### How a computer understands grammar and parts of speech

This is the core of your question. There is no single trick; there is a pipeline,
and QUILL can choose how far down it to go based on cost and accuracy. Each stage
turns raw text into more structure than the last.

1. Tokenization and sentence segmentation. Split text into sentences and words,
   handling abbreviations, decimals, and punctuation. QUILL already has word and
   line tokenizing patterns to build on.
2. Part-of-speech tagging. Label each token with its grammatical category: noun,
   verb, adjective, determiner, preposition, and finer tags (singular noun, past
   tense verb, comparative adjective). This is how the software knows that in
   "the dog runs," "dog" is a singular noun and "runs" is a singular present-tense
   verb, which is what lets it judge subject-verb agreement. POS tagging is a
   solved, well-understood task: a tagger is trained on large hand-labeled corpora
   and learns the probability of each tag given the word and its neighbors.
3. Morphological analysis. Determine number (singular or plural), tense, and
   person from word forms, so the checker can compare "dog/dogs" or "run/runs/ran."
4. Shallow or full parsing. Group tagged words into phrases (noun phrase, verb
   phrase) and, in fuller form, build a dependency tree linking each word to the
   word it modifies or agrees with. The dependency link between subject and verb is
   precisely what an agreement rule inspects.
5. Rule and model checking. With tags and structure in hand, the checker applies
   rules ("a singular subject takes a singular verb"; "this preposition does not
   fit this verb") and statistical signals (this n-gram is improbable) to flag
   likely errors and propose fixes.

The crucial idea: parts of speech are the bridge. Once every word carries an
accurate grammatical tag and the words are linked into phrases, most common grammar
checks become tractable rules over that tagged structure rather than guesses over
raw characters.

### Don't build the engine, adopt one: the open-source options

The first instinct, a hand-written ruleset, is a trap. Real grammar checking is
years of linguistic work, and several mature open-source engines already exist.
The honest job is to pick the one whose language understanding, license, runtime,
and privacy posture fit QUILL, then wrap it. The survey below reflects each
project as of mid-2026.

| Engine | Language stack | License | Offline and private | Coverage | Honest fit for QUILL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Harper (Automattic) | Rust core, callable from Python via a PyO3 binding | Apache-2.0 | Yes, fully local by design | English only today; real POS tagging (its `harper-brill` tagger) and many rules | Strongest fit. No Java, no VM, milliseconds per lint, roughly one-fiftieth of LanguageTool's memory. Cost: a compiled native dependency to bundle and sign per platform, and English-only for now. |
| LanguageTool | Java engine, driven from Python by `language_tool_python` | Engine LGPL 2.1+; Python wrapper GPL-3.0 | Yes, but only via a bundled local Java server; the public-API mode sends text off device and must never be used in QUILL | 25-plus languages, thousands of rules, optional large n-gram data | Most complete and multilingual, but requires bundling a Java 17+ runtime and managing a local server subprocess, a heavy footprint for a Python and wxPython app. The GPL-3.0 wrapper and remote-API default are both cautions. |
| spaCy | Pure Python and Cython | MIT | Yes, fully local | Excellent POS tagging and dependency parsing, many languages | Not a grammar checker; it is the structural toolkit you would build rules on top of. Useful if QUILL ever wants its own multilingual structural layer, but it is a build-it-yourself path, not a finished checker. |
| proselint | Pure Python | BSD | Yes, fully local | Style and usage advice, not true grammar | Lightweight and trivially embeddable, but it lints style, not subject-verb agreement; a complement, not the engine. |
| Consent-gated AI | QUILL's existing AI path | n/a | No, sends text off device | Broadest coverage and fluent rewrites | Best raw coverage and style help, but it must be strictly opt-in per QUILL's no-silent-network rule; latency, cost, and non-determinism apply. |

A note on what each actually understands. Harper, LanguageTool, and spaCy all do
genuine part-of-speech tagging and some structural analysis, which is what lets
them catch agreement and tense errors rather than just typos. proselint does not;
it pattern-matches style. A hand-rolled QUILL ruleset would sit below all of them
and is not worth building when Harper exists.

### The recommended path: Harper first, with honest caveats

For QUILL specifically, the leading candidate is Harper. It is open source
(Apache-2.0), offline and privacy-first by design, fast and light enough to run
live in an editor, and it does real POS tagging, which is exactly the
parts-of-speech understanding the checker needs. Crucially for QUILL, it needs no
Java and no virtual machine.

The caveats must be stated plainly, because they drive the engineering:

- Harper is written in Rust, not Python. It is callable from Python through a
  PyO3 binding (`harper-python`, published on crates.io under Apache-2.0), but
  under the hood QUILL would load a compiled native extension and ship a
  per-platform wheel or binary that has to be built and code-signed alongside the
  app. This is the same class of work as any native dependency, just without a
  JVM.
- At the time of writing, the `harper-python` crate is confirmed, but a prebuilt
  PyPI wheel under that name could not be verified; QUILL should confirm the exact
  Python distribution, its API, and platform wheel availability before depending on
  it, and be ready to build the binding from the Rust crate if needed.
- Harper is English-only today. Writers needing other languages would fall back to
  the (heavier, multilingual) LanguageTool engine or to consent-gated AI.

The staged recommendation, then, is engine-led rather than rule-led: wrap Harper
as the default local, private grammar engine behind a feature flag; offer
LanguageTool as an opt-in heavyweight for writers who need its breadth of
languages and rules, bundling its Java server only when enabled; and expose deep,
fluent AI grammar only through QUILL's existing consent gate. spaCy stays in
reserve as the toolkit if QUILL ever wants to grow its own multilingual structural
checks.

### Why this is genuinely complex, stated plainly

You called grammar complex, and that is correct. The honest difficulties:

- Ambiguity is everywhere. "Time flies" can be a noun and verb or an adjective and
  noun; many words are several parts of speech, and the tagger must use context.
- Real grammar needs structure, not just words. Subject-verb agreement can span a
  long clause ("The list of items *is* on the desk," not "are"), so a checker that
  ignores phrase structure gets it wrong.
- False positives erode trust fast. A grammar checker that nags about correct
  sentences is worse than none; tuning for precision over recall matters more than
  raw coverage.
- Language and dialect specificity. Rules and models are per-language, and even
  within English the conventions differ; QUILL must let the writer set the variety.
- Performance under live editing. Re-checking a large document on every keystroke
  is infeasible; the engine must check incrementally around edits, exactly as the
  spelling scanner already works outward from the caret.

### Surfacing grammar through QUILL's existing accessible machinery

Here the earlier request for "keyboard commands, a dialog, and more to help with
all of the document interaction" is answered directly. Grammar reuses every
spelling surface, so a screen-reader user already knows how to drive it.

- Keyboard commands. "Next grammar issue" and "Previous grammar issue" walk
  findings from the caret, each landing spoken with its category and a short
  explanation ("subject-verb agreement, line 12: the subject *list* is singular,
  so use *is*"). "Explain grammar issue here" speaks the full rationale on demand.
  "Apply suggested fix" and "Apply fix and continue" accept a rewrite and move on.
  "Ignore once" and "Ignore this rule" tune the noise. All bind through the
  QUILL-key system and appear in the command palette.
- A grammar dialog. A dedicated, accessible review dialog (native or QUILL's web
  surface, registered under the DLG-3 dialog estate) walks issues one at a time
  with the sentence in context, the category, the plain-language explanation, the
  parts of speech it is reasoning about ("*list*: singular noun; *are*: plural
  verb"), and a list of suggested rewrites the writer can choose from, with Apply,
  Skip, Ignore, and Ignore Rule. This mirrors the existing spell-check dialog so it
  is instantly familiar.
- A grammar tree navigator. The same `_NavigatorNode` tree that lists misspellings
  lists grammar findings grouped by category (Agreement, Tense, Punctuation, Word
  choice), each node spoken with its location and an excerpt, each Enter jumping to
  the occurrence. A writer can survey every structural concern in the document by
  ear, then fix them in order.
- As-you-type, like spelling. An optional live mode flags issues incrementally
  around edits and announces them with the restraint QUILL already applies to
  spelling, never interrupting flow, always available on demand.
- The context menu. Right-clicking a flagged span offers the suggested fixes,
  Explain, Ignore, and Ignore Rule inline, exactly as spelling suggestions appear
  in the editor context menu today.
- Honest, spoken explanations. The defining QUILL difference: every finding is
  explained in plain language and, when useful, names the parts of speech it
  reasoned about, so a writer does not just hear *that* something is wrong but
  *why*, and learns from it. That is grammar checking that teaches, by ear.

### Architecture and where it lives

- The grammar layer is wrapped behind a pure, `wx`-free adapter in `quill/core`
  (for example `quill/core/grammar.py`) that returns typed issue records exactly as
  `spellcheck.py` returns `Misspelling` records, so the rest of the app never sees
  which engine produced a finding. Swapping Harper for LanguageTool or AI is an
  adapter change, not an app change.
- The engine itself (the Harper native binding, or an optional bundled
  LanguageTool server) lives at the platform boundary, loaded lazily with the same
  cache-locking discipline the spelling wordlist uses and with background preload
  so the first check never stalls the editor. Because the engine is native and
  cannot be imported on Linux CI, the adapter is tested against a fake engine, and
  the record-shaping logic stays pure and fully unit-tested, mirroring how QUILL
  already keeps wx and other heavy dependencies out of `core` tests.
- All UI (commands, dialog, tree navigator, context menu, announcements) lives in
  `quill/ui` and reuses existing surfaces, so the new code is mostly the adapter
  plus thin wiring.
- The optional AI engine routes only through the existing consent-gated AI path and
  the egress audit; no grammar engine may make a silent outbound call, which also
  means LanguageTool's public-API mode is forbidden and only its bundled local
  server is permitted.
- Feature-flagged through FeatureManager so grammar (and each engine) can be
  enabled per profile.

### Recommendation

Do not hand-roll a grammar checker; adopt a real engine and treat grammar as
"spelling, with structure." The leading choice for QUILL is Harper: open source
(Apache-2.0), offline, privacy-first, fast enough to run live, real POS tagging,
and no Java. Accept its honest costs (a Rust native binding to package per
platform, English-only for now, and a Python distribution to verify) and wrap it
behind a pure `quill/core` adapter that emits the same typed records as
spellcheck. Offer LanguageTool as an opt-in multilingual heavyweight (bundled
local Java server only, never its remote API), keep spaCy in reserve as a
structural toolkit, and expose fluent AI grammar only through QUILL's existing
consent gate. Whichever engine answers, make the finding *speak its reasoning*,
parts of speech included, so QUILL becomes not just a grammar checker but the rare
one a blind writer can fully hear, interrogate, and learn from.

## Closing note

Part One argues QUILL can host a rich surface without betraying its plain-text,
screen-reader-first heart, provided it refactors to an editor-surface protocol
first and keeps the rich control an honest, opt-in power mode. Part Two argues the
best ideas in the category's most admired markup app, Ulysses, can each be brought
into QUILL in a form that is more accessible than the original. Part Three proposes
Compose mode, a workshop that assembles a document from reorderable, re-levelable
parts across Markdown, RTF, and HTML with a live, screen-reader-legible HTML
preview and a rich spoken context menu for architecting structure by ear. Part
Four designs keywords as spoken objects a writer can add, hear, filter, and jump
through without ever seeing a chip. Part Five shows how grammar checking can
understand parts of speech and sentence structure, in tiers from a private local
ruleset to opt-in AI, and surface every finding, reasoning included, through the
same accessible commands, dialog, and tree QUILL already uses for spelling.

The throughline of all five is one ambition: take features the rest of the
industry built for the eye, and make QUILL the place where they finally speak.
