# Publishing Providers Framework Restart Handoff

## Branch And Baseline

- repository: `C:\code\git-src\quill`
- branch: `feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- upstream tracking branch: `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`
- baseline before Phase 1 slice A: `5181feb9`

## Implemented State

- `quill/core/publishing_adapters.py` defines the trusted bundled adapter.
- `quill/core/publishing_bundled/wordpress.py` returns a package-shaped
  WordPress adapter using existing registry objects.
- `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_adapters.py` covers successful WordPress
  adaptation and pre-exposure rejection of invalid shapes.
- User-visible publishing behavior is unchanged.

## Validation

- focused adapter/publishing/provider-gate battery: `34 passed in 0.69s`
- Ruff: passed
- `python -m quill.tools.check_publishing_providers`: passed

## Resume Boundary

Continue Phase 1 only. The next decision is whether WordPress should bootstrap
through the bundled adapter during normal app startup. Preserve existing
provider/client identity and behavior if implementing that slice.

Do not begin schedule publish, compare/sync, Quillin worker execution, or live
third-party provider loading unless the user explicitly expands scope.
