# Codex Handoff

## 2026-06-18 Testing Discipline Checkpoint

- user confirmed the process for future development:
  - run focused tests for each touched behavior
  - run the full available unit-test battery before considering a development slice complete
  - fix in-scope failures before committing
  - record but do not fix unrelated merged-main/environment-sensitive failures unless the slice touches those areas
  - commit locally as work proceeds
  - do not push
- latest full-suite baseline after provider/client validation extraction: `3726 passed, 11 skipped, 54 failed, 2 warnings`
## 2026-06-18 Provider/Client Validation Slice

- implemented the next extraction-prep slice from the plan
- new core validation API:
  - `PublishingProviderValidationIssue`
  - `validate_publishing_provider_client(...)`
  - `validate_registered_publishing_provider_clients(...)`
- validation checks:
  - provider definition registered without a matching client
  - client registered without a provider definition
  - implemented operation declared without a required callable client method
- tests added around a fake partial provider/client to pin drift detection before WordPress is moved toward a first-party bundled Quillin boundary
- verification:
  - `ruff format quill\core\publishing_validation.py tests\unit\core\test_publishing.py`
  - `ruff check quill\core\publishing_validation.py tests\unit\core\test_publishing.py` -> all checks passed
  - focused publishing/framework tests: `20 passed in 0.59s`
  - broader core publishing tests: `39 passed in 3.89s`
- no push performed
## 2026-06-18 Upstream Access Recovery Checkpoint

- user requested a full recovery pass across Codex planning docs, memory files, and working chat logs after the head developer granted push access and resolved conflicts before creating the branch
- current repository state:
  - branch: `feature/publishing-providers-framework`
  - tracking: `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`
  - remote: `https://github.com/community-access/quill`
  - HEAD: `cbe5ed6 Merge branch 'features/publishing-providers-framework' of https://github.com/stickbear2015/quill into feature/publishing-providers-framework`
  - `main` / `origin/main`: `7a64564 chore(docs): drop relocated 0.5.0 release notes and old verbosity plan`
- current working tree was clean before this recovery-doc update
- interpretation:
  - prior fork-only instructions remain useful as history
  - active work should now proceed on upstream `origin/feature/publishing-providers-framework`
  - the latest merge commit is the recovered branch state and should be treated as the current baseline
- merge commit details reviewed:
  - reconciled publishing branch with `origin/main` at `7a64564`
  - rebaselined module-size budgets for publishing/main-menu growth and added explicit entries for the new publishing modules
  - regenerated dialog inventory and main-frame public-surface fixtures
  - repaired merge-sensitive UI/menu/power-tools tests after conflict resolution
  - precommit gates green: ruff format, ruff check, banned-pattern, dialog escape-button contract, module-size budget, announce-gap gate
  - tests recorded: `tests/unit/ui/` 690/690 pass; `tests/unit/core/` 2544 pass + 4 skipped + 11 thesaurus timeouts deselected
  - residual noted by merge author: 12 `test_brf_page_detection.py` failures pre-exist on `origin/main` and are unrelated to this merge
- current instruction:
  - do not continue into the next plan implementation yet
  - tighten recovery/review notes and any merge-readiness checklist before selecting the next slice
- recovery docs updated together:
  - `codex-notes/plans/publishing-providers-framework.md`
  - `codex-notes/memory/publishing-providers-framework-readiness.md`
  - `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`
  - `codex-notes/logs/codex-review-log.md`

## 2026-06-18 Fork Push and Upstream PR Checkpoint

- pushed `features/publishing-providers-framework` to the fork remote:
  - `https://github.com/stickbear2015/quill.git`
- created upstream pull request with GitHub CLI:
  - `https://github.com/Community-Access/quill/pull/268`
- source branch:
  - `stickbear2015:features/publishing-providers-framework`
- target branch:
  - `Community-Access/quill:main`
- user clarified that future upstream-repo branch updates should wait until they are given access
- current instruction for this checkpoint:
  - push documentation/log updates to the fork remote only
  - do not push directly to `Community-Access/quill`

## 2026-06-18 Provider Operation Capability Slice

- implemented explicit provider operation capability metadata
- added operation support for:
  - verify
  - browse
  - load
  - update
  - create
  - publish
- WordPress declares all current operations as the reference provider
- core publishing actions now check provider operation support before calling clients
- publish actions require `publish` capability:
  - publish current post/page
  - publish already-open remote content
- fake second-provider tests prove a provider can support verification without browse/publish
- verification:
  - focused core run: `35 passed in 3.42s`
  - wider publishing/UI/governance run: `122 passed in 42.70s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Remote Publish Lifecycle Slice

- implemented provider-neutral publish/promote for already-open remote publishing content
- added command/menu wiring for:
  - `publishing.publish_remote_item`
- File > Publish now includes:
  - `Publish Open Remote Content...`
- behavior:
  - only runs from a tab opened from publishing remote content
  - verifies current connection exists
  - checks stored provider id and site URL against the current connection before writing
  - reuses the existing review-first confirmation and result message path
- provider/client coverage:
  - `PublishingProviderClient.update_remote_item(...)` now accepts optional `status`
  - WordPress update payload includes `status: publish` only for this publish-open-remote path
  - normal update remote content still sends title/content only
- verification:
  - first focused run passed behavior/a11y/governance but failed module-size ratchet from deliberate command/menu growth
  - budget notes updated for:
    - `quill/ui/main_frame.py` `24240 -> 24269`
    - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py` `3364 -> 3377`
  - rerun passed:
    - `120 passed in 62.51s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Publish Now Lifecycle Slice

- implemented the next provider-neutral publishing lifecycle step after the break
- added command/menu wiring for:
  - `publishing.publish_current`
  - `publishing.publish_current_page`
- File > Publish now includes:
  - `Publish Post Now...`
  - `Publish Page Now...`
- reused the existing create-provider path with `status="publish"` rather than adding WordPress-specific shell behavior
- reused the existing review-first confirmation and result message surfaces
- no new dialog surface was added
- provider/client coverage:
  - WordPress create payload now has regression coverage for `status: publish`
  - command/menu tests cover the new provider-neutral publish-now actions
- verification:
  - first focused run passed behavior/a11y/governance but failed module-size ratchet from deliberate command/menu growth
  - budget notes updated for:
    - `quill/ui/main_frame.py` `24214 -> 24240`
    - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py` `3344 -> 3364`
  - rerun passed:
    - `119 passed in 32.58s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Break-Ready Remote Sync Checkpoint

- final break checkpoint after:
  - provider registry and verification seam
  - WordPress future first-party Quillin direction
  - remote item editor identity
- latest focused validation remains:
  - `117 passed in 62.98s`
- branch is ready to push so remote and local are aligned for a clean break
- next likely work after break:
  - continue provider-neutral publishing lifecycle behavior on top of the registry and identity seams
  - or revisit deeper browse scaling if product wants more collection loading before lifecycle expansion

## 2026-06-18 Remote Item Editor Identity Slice

- implemented the next plan slice after the provider-registry seam
- added generic metadata-backed document display names:
  - local file paths still win
  - pathless documents may use `source_metadata["display_name"]`
  - blank/pathless documents still show `Untitled`
- publishing remote opens now store:
  - `display_name`
  - `source_label`
  - `publishing_remote_title`
- publishing create/update success paths refresh the saved remote title/display name from the provider response
- existing tab/title refresh now shows remote item identity without inventing a fake local file path
- accessibility/product alignment:
  - no new dialog surface
  - existing tab/title/status update path remains in place
  - authoritative remote linkage metadata stays separate from UI display identity
- verification:
  - first focused run passed behavior/a11y/governance but failed module-size ratchet from `main_frame.py` growth
  - budget note updated for `quill/ui/main_frame.py` `24205 -> 24214`
  - rerun passed:
    - `117 passed in 62.98s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 WordPress as Future Bundled Quillin Direction

- recorded the architecture decision prompted by the provider-registry seam:
  - keep WordPress in-tree as the reference provider while framework contracts are still being proven
  - continue building provider-neutral core seams so WordPress remains extractable
  - treat WordPress-as-first-party-bundled-Quillin as the likely end-state after provider loading policy and lifecycle contracts are stable
- no runtime behavior changed in this documentation checkpoint
- next implementation work remains `Remote Item Editor Identity`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Provider Registry and Verification Seam Slice

- implemented the highest-risk framework-neutrality cleanup requested after the audit
- added explicit provider metadata registration in `publishing_providers.py`:
  - `register_publishing_provider(...)`
  - `unregister_publishing_provider(...)`
- added explicit provider client registration in `publishing_clients.py`:
  - `register_publishing_provider_client(...)`
  - `unregister_publishing_provider_client(...)`
- moved publishing connection verification behind `PublishingProviderClient.verify_connection(...)`
- moved WordPress app-password verification into `WordPressPublishingClient`
- stopped unknown provider IDs from falling back to WordPress metadata or behavior
- added a fake second provider test proving:
  - the shell can verify a non-WordPress provider through a registered client
  - app-password auth no longer implies WordPress
  - unknown providers report as unregistered rather than using WordPress defaults
- updated the network-egress audit rationale to follow the moved verification call site
- verification:
  - initial run exposed only a missing `.tmp` parent for pytest's `--basetemp`
  - after creating `.tmp`, focused publishing/governance validation passed:
    - `113 passed in 31.29s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Provider-Neutral Publishing Copy Slice

- performed the provider-boundary cleanup requested after the audit
- renamed browse UI/menu/status copy from published-only wording to publishing-content wording:
  - `Browse Publishing Content...`
  - `Publishing content`
  - `Selected publishing content details`
- added provider-owned content-kind labels in `publishing_providers.py`
  - WordPress still exposes `Post`/`Page`
  - the browse dialog now builds its content-scope choices from provider content kinds rather than fixed `Posts and pages` strings
- updated core/provider-client messages from `published content` to `publishing content` where drafts may be included
- accessibility/product alignment:
  - no new dialog surface
  - visible labels and accessible names remain matched
  - browse copy now matches the draft-inclusive status scope
- verification:
  - first focused run passed behavior/dialog checks but failed module-size ratchet after provider-label growth
  - budget note was updated for:
    - `quill/ui/publishing_tools.py` `699 -> 715`
    - `quill/core/publishing.py` `676 -> 677`
  - rerun passed:
    - `111 passed in 32.46s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Browse Partial Results Slice

- continued the next `Browse Remote Content Scaling` work after the confirmation model slice
- implemented timeout-aware partial results for multi-kind WordPress browse:
  - posts/pages are still fetched as separate provider calls
  - if one requested content kind loads and another fails, Quill now keeps the loaded items
  - the result message names the failed content slice and suggests retrying with a narrower content scope
  - single-kind or all-failed browse still reports the provider error and returns no items
- accessibility/product alignment:
  - existing browse dialog remains unchanged, so label order and keyboard flow stay intact
  - the native result message is plain-language and names the partial-load state for screen readers
  - no new custom dialog surface was added
- verification:
  - `pytest tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py tests/unit/tools/test_module_size_budget.py tests/unit/tools/test_check_banned_patterns.py tests/unit/tools/test_announce_gap.py tests/unit/tools/test_network_egress_audit.py tests/unit/tools/test_dialog_button_contract.py tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_hardening_contract.py -q --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-publishing-browse-partial`
  - result: `110 passed in 31.38s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Publishing Confirmation Model Slice

- continued from the plan after the browse status scope slice
- implemented the next approved `Publishing Confirmation Model` refinement:
  - create/update publishing success dialogs now use a shared explicit result formatter
  - outcome copy reports target site, content kind, title, resulting state, and returned URL when available
  - status bar updates use the concise first line only so multi-line result text does not clutter the live status region
- no new dialog surface was added; existing native message boxes remain the governed confirmation surface
- desktop accessibility alignment:
  - pre-send confirmations remain explicit and keyboard-confirmed
  - post-send feedback is plain language and screen-reader friendly
  - failure paths still preserve provider error wording
- module-size ratchet was remeasured and documented for the deliberate growth:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame.py`: `24194 -> 24205`
  - `quill/core/publishing.py`: `651 -> 676`
- verification:
  - first focused run had only module-size budget failures from the measured growth
  - after budget documentation, focused publishing/governance run passed:
    - `109 passed in 32.31s`
- branch remains `features/publishing-providers-framework`; no push was performed

## 2026-06-18 Browse Status Scope Slice

- implemented the next plan-directed publishing browse step from the 2026-06-12 addendum:
  - browse now defaults to both published content and drafts
  - browse accepts provider-neutral status filters
  - the WordPress client sends an explicit status scope in collection queries
  - the existing browse dialog now has a keyboard-reachable `Status to browse` choice:
    - `Published and drafts`
    - `Published only`
    - `Drafts only`
- kept the slice inside the existing governed browse dialog instead of adding a new dialog
- aligned publishing dialogs with current main's GATE-12 announce-gap requirement by threading `announce_cb` from MainFrame into publishing dialogs
- preserved current main's dialog and message-box governance:
  - `apply_modal_ids`
  - `show_modal_dialog`
  - `show_message_box`
  - no raw `ShowModal`
  - no raw `wx.MessageBox`

## 2026-06-18 Latest Verification

- focused publishing plus current-main governance verification passed
- result: `106 passed in 51.90s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`

  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_hardening_contract.py`
- run detail:
  - used workspace-local temp path:
    - `--basetemp=.tmp/pytest-publishing-browse-status`

## 2026-06-18 Main Merge Refresh

- fetched latest `origin/main`, which advanced to `2a92c03`
- merged `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- resolved conflicts by preserving current main behavior and reapplying publishing-owned surfaces:
  - kept both `future.publishing` and main's new `future.ai_menu_top_level` feature definitions
  - kept publishing under `File > Publish`, now using the same localized menu-label pattern as current main
  - regenerated dialog inventory and MainFrame public-surface fixtures from the integrated tree
  - refreshed module-size budgets for the integrated main-plus-publishing baseline
  - replaced publishing dialog raw `wx.MessageBox` calls with the shared dialog-contract message wrapper required by the current GATE-16 checker

## 2026-06-18 Latest Verification

- focused publishing plus merge-sensitive verification passed
- result: `124 passed in 55.82s`

- run detail:
  - used workspace-local temp path:
    - `--basetemp=.tmp/pytest-publishing-merge-20260618-final`

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Broader Merge-Sensitive Verification

- ran a broader merge-sensitive suite across the `main` shell surfaces that publishing extends:
  - `main_frame`
  - file/menu wiring
  - remote-sites coexistence
  - dialog governance
  - feature wiring
  - network and module-budget gates
- intent of this pass was to validate our publishing integration against current `main`, not to re-own unrelated `main` feature behavior

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Latest Verification

- broader publishing-integration verification passed
- result: `424 passed in 36.44s`
- run detail:
  - used workspace-local temp path:
    - `--basetemp=.tmp/pytest-publishing-broader`

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Publishing Verification + CLAUDE Cleanup

- restored `CLAUDE.md` to match `main` so the accessibility-heading guidance lives only in local `AGENTS.md`
- reran the publishing-owned verification slice against the merged branch state rather than the unrelated broader `main` additions
- confirmed the integrated publishing code still passes with current `main`

## 2026-06-14 16:21:11 -04:00 Latest Verification

- focused publishing-owned plus governance verification passed
- result: `121 passed in 43.18s`
- verification set:

## 2026-06-12 19:10:42 -04:00 Clean Handoff State

- branch is being left in a clean documented stopping state for push
- latest pass in this checkpoint is documentation-only
- no additional product code changed after the last publishing implementation and startup-regression fix commit

Current practical state:

- publishing branch includes:
  - browse/open remote content
  - update remote content
  - create post draft
  - create page draft
- merged-main startup regression has been repaired and documented
- planning now explicitly covers the next likely product/design work:
  - browse scaling and timeout handling
  - draft visibility in browse
  - stronger publishing confirmation and result feedback
  - remote item title/tab identity

Push expectation from this checkpoint:

- commit the current documentation and planning updates
- push so the remote branch reflects the same clean stop state

## 2026-06-12 19:05:06 -04:00 Documentation Language Correction

- corrected the latest planning-note wording so it does not frame Quill as being only for blind users
- current intended framing remains:
  - accessibility-first
  - strong non-visual feedback
  - provider-neutral publishing design
  - broader user audience than a single accessibility group
- no product code or behavior changed in this documentation pass

## 2026-06-12 18:42:20 -04:00 Startup Regression Fix

- fixed a launch-blocking startup regression introduced by the merged upstream menu split
- failure was:
  - missing `MainFrame._append_power_tools_file_create_items`
- this was an upstream/main integration bug, not a publishing-slice regression
- resolution:
  - added the missing helper to `PowerToolsMenuMixin`
  - added a regression test so menu-builder helper calls cannot drift from mixin definitions again

## 2026-06-12 18:42:20 -04:00 Latest Verification

- targeted startup-regression plus publishing-owned verification passed
- result: `40 passed in 1.85s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the first local-to-remote publish/create slice
- Quill now supports:
  - `Create Post Draft...`
  - `Create Page Draft...`
- both actions are available under `File > Publish`
- both actions are command-registered publishing commands, so they stay compatible with command-palette discovery and feature gating
- successful create flows now attach publishing-remote metadata to the current tab so later `Update Remote Content...` can target the created remote item

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Latest Verification

- publishing-owned create/update/browse slice passed
- result: `39 passed in 1.94s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:31:56 -04:00 Next Read

- branch now covers:
  - connection storage and verification
  - browse/open remote publishing content
  - update existing remote content
  - create new remote post/page drafts from local documents
- likely next meaningful slice is the first non-draft publish-state step:
  - publish current draft/item
  - or a tighter “promote created draft” flow if we want to keep scope small
- no new governed custom dialog was added in the draft-create slice; the flow still relies on review-first confirmation prompts only

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the planned publishing `Update Remote Content...` slice
- Quill can now update an opened publishing-remote post or page back to the provider through:
  - `File > Publish > Update Remote Content...`
- the update flow is explicit and review-first
- the flow now respects the saved authoring surface from the open step:
  - Markdown-authored remote tabs render to HTML body content on send
  - explicitly HTML-authored remote tabs send raw HTML unchanged
- successful update responses now refresh remote metadata on the current document:
  - status
  - updated timestamp
  - remote URL

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Latest Verification

- publishing-owned update slice passed after implementation
- result: `36 passed in 1.58s`
- verification set:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`

## 2026-06-12 18:15:44 -04:00 Next Read

- branch is ready for the next publishing slice after remote-update behavior
- likely next work should focus on the remaining publish/create path rather than more remote-open representation work
- before committing, keep in mind there is still local assistant-guidance noise in the workspace:
  - untracked `AGENTS.md`
  - modified `CLAUDE.md`
  These should stay out of the branch unless the user explicitly wants them tracked.

## 2026-06-12 17:30:59 -04:00 Clean Stop State

- removed leftover local temp/cache noise after the upstream resync audit
- corrected the mistaken repo-local guidance-file drift:
  - no repo `AGENTS.md`
  - no repo-local accessibility override left in `CLAUDE.md`
- no product behavior changed in this cleanup pass

Current practical state:

- publishing branch is synced with upstream and already pushed
- publishing integration remains healthy against current `main`
- workspace temp/cache noise has been cleared
- remaining tracked work from this pass is documentation-only

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Current Merge State

- local `main` has been resynced to current `origin/main`
- synced `main` has been pushed to `fork/main`
- publishing branch has been updated with the latest upstream changes as of `97d04f6`

Current integration read:

- publishing still fits cleanly on top of new upstream shell changes
- new GitHub Remote work lives under `File > Open from Remote`
- publishing remains separate under `File > Publish`
- dialog inventory and MainFrame public-surface snapshots have been regenerated from merged source
- module-size budgets have been refreshed to acknowledge the integrated publishing branch state

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Latest Verification

- maintained publishing plus merge-sensitive slice passed against the new upstream baseline
- result: `129 passed in 19.12s`

## 2026-06-12 17:27:38 -04:00 Next Read

- branch is current with upstream again
- publishing foundation still looks healthy after the sync
- next product slice remains the explicit `Update Remote Content...` workflow unless product direction changes

## 2026-06-10 23:09:01 -04:00 Final Stop State

- this branch is being left in a documentation-synced stopping state
- handoff, review log, and memory note have all been refreshed together
- no product-code changes were made in this final pass
- expected final action after this handoff update:
  - commit doc updates
  - push branch so nothing remains pending afterward

Current practical state:

- branch: `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- publishing foundation remains merged with current `origin/main`
- maintained publishing/merge-sensitive validation remains last known green at `87 passed in 9.85s`
- Codex support artifacts now live under `codex-notes/`

## 2026-06-10 23:03:19 -04:00 Codex Notes Home

- Codex support artifacts have now been centralized under `codex-notes/`
- current canonical locations:
  - handoff: `codex-notes/handoff/codex-handoff.md`
  - review log: `codex-notes/logs/codex-review-log.md`
  - branch memory: `codex-notes/memory/`
  - planning docs: `codex-notes/plans/`
  - one-off notes: `codex-notes/notes/`
- this was a housekeeping-only pass; no product behavior changed

## 2026-06-10 22:56:23 -04:00 Repo Organization

- next immediate work is repo housekeeping, not product code
- user requested:
  - commit the current readiness-assessment note/log state first
  - then consolidate planning/log/handoff/note artifacts into a central folder
- expected follow-up after this checkpoint:
  - centralize Codex process docs under one top-level location
  - update any references that still assume root-level note files
  - record the moves in the review log and handoff

## 2026-06-10 22:48:16 -04:00 Merge Readiness

- assessed whether the publishing branch should be merged to `main` now
- created:
  - `publishing-main-merge-readiness-note-2026-06-10.md`
- current recommendation is to hold off on a direct merge

Reasoning summary:

- the implemented publishing slice is stable and reviewable
- the full end-to-end publishing workflow is still incomplete
- `main` has recently been moving quickly in nearby UI architecture:
  - remote I/O
  - menu consolidation
  - notebook workspace
  - Node runtime / Quillins packaging
- this branch also contains branch-process documentation that should likely be reviewed before any full merge to `main`

Practical recommendation:

- okay to open or maintain a draft PR for visibility
- better to finish `Update Remote Content...` and do a cleanup/scoping pass before asking for final merge

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Merge + Audit

- merged current `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- resolved integration conflicts in:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
- refreshed `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json` for notebook public methods now present from merged `main`
- publishing branch behavior remains intact after merge:
  - remote publishing browse/open still defaults to `Readable Markdown`
  - per-open `Raw HTML` override still exists
  - explicit representation metadata still flows into the opened document state

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Latest Verification

- reran the maintained branch-owned publishing plus merge-sensitive slice:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
- result: `87 passed in 9.85s`

## 2026-06-10 22:27:23 -04:00 Recommended Next Slice

- branch is in a safe place to resume implementation
- next coding target remains `Update Remote Content...`
- suggested scope:
  - reuse stored publishing metadata from the current document
  - decide Markdown-to-HTML conversion versus raw-HTML send based on the saved authoring surface / representation
  - keep the flow aligned with merged remote-site and notebook-era menu/state conventions

## 2026-06-10 17:40:40 -04:00 Stopping Point

- branch is in a stable stopping state
- remote-open publishing representation work is committed and already pushed
- in-repo planning notes now include:
  - `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
  - `publishing-remote-integration-planning-2026-06-10.md`
- recommended next implementation slice when resuming:
  - `Update Remote Content...`
  - use the stored publishing authoring-surface metadata to decide Markdown-to-HTML conversion versus raw-HTML send path

## 2026-06-10 17:13:23 -04:00 Latest Coding Update

- completed the planned remote-open representation slice for publishing content
- browse/open now defaults to `Readable Markdown`
- browse/open now offers per-open `Raw HTML`
- added conservative fallback to `Raw HTML` for content Quill should not flatten misleadingly
- publishing-open metadata now records the chosen authoring surface from prepared content instead of hard-coded HTML assumptions

## 2026-06-10 17:13:23 -04:00 Latest Verification

- maintained publishing slice rerun after implementation:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 87 passed in 9.96s

## 2026-06-10 16:19:03 -04:00 Maintainer Note

- main-branch findings from the reverted full-suite audit are preserved separately in:
  - `main-branch-audit-note-2026-06-10.md`
- branch work remains scoped to publishing after that note capture

## 2026-06-10 16:15:07 -04:00 Scope Correction

- reverted the out-of-scope audit-only changes from the mistaken full-suite pass
- reset verification back to the branch-owned publishing slice only

## 2026-06-10 16:15:07 -04:00 Current Verification

- reran the maintained publishing-focused slice:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 84 passed in 9.75s

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Audit Update

- ran a full `pytest -q` audit after the merged-`main` integration work
- fixed the stale test cluster that was still assuming pre-merge `QUILL_DATA_DIR` behavior
- added shared home-scoped test data setup in `tests/conftest.py`
- updated persistence/config test files to honor current `main`'s dev-only home-constrained data-dir contract
- tightened two suite hot spots:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_net_tls.py` now prefilters files before AST parsing
  - `quill/core/thesaurus.py` now avoids double synonym cleaning during thesaurus parse

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Audit Verification

- focused repair slices now pass:
  - stale persistence/config failures: 11 passed
  - IPC/keymap/menu persistence verification: 11 passed
  - TLS audit verification: 5 passed
  - thesaurus reset-cache timeout repro: 1 passed in isolation
- full suite is improved but still not fully green in one uninterrupted run
- current blocking point:
  - `tests/unit/core/test_reset_caches.py::test_thesaurus_preload_after_reset_is_idempotent`
- current read:
  - isolated behavior is green
  - remaining problem appears to be suite-run timeout/performance pressure, not a confirmed publishing regression

## 2026-06-10 15:57:07 -04:00 Recommended Next Slice

- if the suite is stabilized fully green, next planned code work should still be remote-open representation handling:
  - open publishing remotes as `Readable Markdown` by default
  - allow `Raw HTML` override when needed
  - keep representation metadata explicit for follow-on save/update flows

## Latest Merge Update

- resynced local `main` with `origin/main` after upstream advanced by 4 commits
- pushed refreshed `main` to `fork/main`
- merged updated `main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- upstream changes included a substantial new Remote Sites feature touching:
  - `quill/ui/main_frame.py`
  - `quill/ui/main_frame_menu.py`
  - dialog inventory/public-surface fixtures
  - network-egress audit
  - module-size budgets
- reapplied the branch's earlier publishing-audit tighten-ups on top of that merge:
  - explicit raw-HTML publishing-open metadata in `main_frame.py`
  - test fixes for the current dev-only `QUILL_DATA_DIR` contract
  - publishing checklist/readiness/plan updates
- resolved merge conflicts in:
  - `quill/tools/module_size_budgets.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- regenerated dialog/public-surface snapshots from merged source
- merge commit created: `47d5ff7` (`Merge main into features/publishing-providers-framework`)

## Latest Verification

- focused integrated test slice passed after the merge and reapply work:
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_characterization.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_dialog_inventory.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_menu_contract.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_budgets.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_browse.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_publishing_framework.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_features.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_publishing_connection_dialog_a11y.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame.py`
  - `tests/unit/core/test_remote_sites.py`
  - `tests/unit/ui/test_remote_sites_dialog.py`
- result: 84 passed

## Latest Audit Update

- performed a branch audit after merging current `main`
- confirmed the publishing branch still aligns with the approved architecture in these areas:
  - feature gating
  - `File > Publish` menu placement
  - dialog governance
  - explicit network-egress review
  - provider-aware core seam for WordPress browse/open
- confirmed the main remaining behavior gap versus the plan is remote-open representation:
  - current implementation opens remote content as raw HTML
  - approved next step is still `Readable Markdown` by default with a per-open `Raw HTML` override and conservative fallback
- tightened the current code to record explicit publishing-open metadata for the interim raw-HTML behavior
- updated `dialogs.md` and local readiness/planning notes to match the real post-merge state
- updated older publishing/feature tests so they honor the current `main` dev-only `QUILL_DATA_DIR` contract from `quill/core/paths.py`
- verified the focused audit slice after those updates: 53 tests passed

## Current State

- Branch: `features/publishing-providers-framework`
- Stage: planning plus implementation/audit alignment
- Coding status: code exists; next work should follow the updated plan and merged-main constraints
- Branch baseline: merged with `main` again on 2026-06-10 after syncing `fork/main` to `origin/main`

## Latest Planning Decisions

- remote content opens as `Readable Markdown` by default
- the open flow provides a per-open override to `Raw HTML`
- Quill automatically falls back to `Raw HTML` when conversion would be too lossy or structurally untrustworthy
- convert only clearly text-first HTML to `Readable Markdown`
- fall back to `Raw HTML` for anything interactive, embedded, layout-heavy, or structurally rich

## Next Likely Planning Step

- refine the fallback boundary into a more exact decision list
- define what metadata must be stored to remember the chosen authoring surface
- check whether the new Remote Sites shell patterns from `main` suggest any publishing-shell simplifications worth adopting before the next publish/update slice
- keep the design provider-neutral and accessibility-first

## Resume Instruction

When returning later, tell Codex:

`Check codex-handoff.md and codex-review-log.md first, then continue planning.`

## 2026-06-14 Main Merge Refresh

- merged the latest `origin/main` into `features/publishing-providers-framework` again, this time bringing in the close-fix follow-up and braille/mainline work from `d861abb` (`feat(braille): Phase 5 translation + docs; fix(#210): never trap the editor open`)
- resolved the merge by keeping upstream main behavior for:
  - braille feature/catalog/settings/statusbar wiring
  - `_on_close` hard-exit + crash-report recovery flow
  - consolidated docs/release notes
- re-applied only the publishing-owned pieces on top:
  - `future.publishing` feature definition/profile visibility
  - `File > Publish` menu and command surfaces
  - publishing remote metadata and provider-neutral flows
- regenerated:
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/dialog_inventory.json`
  - `tests/unit/ui/fixtures/main_frame_public_surface.json`
- corrected the menu-contract test so it reads all `main_frame*.py` modules again, including the power-tools helper definitions that publishing still depends on
- confirmed `CLAUDE.md` matches `origin/main`

## 2026-06-14 Verification Refresh

  - result: `429 passed`
- full branch suite status in this environment:
  - `pytest -q --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-all-branch` stops during collection in `tests/unit/ui/test_update_manager.py` because upstream dependencies are missing (`requests`, then `platform_utils`)
  - after installing `requests`, `pytest -q --ignore tests/unit/ui/test_update_manager.py --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-all-minus-update-manager` still reveals upstream/mainline failures outside publishing ownership:
    - `tests/unit/core/ai/test_ai_sessions.py::test_list_and_most_recent`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_begin_session_offers_previous_unclean_snapshot`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_latest_session_snapshot_and_reader`
    - `tests/unit/core/test_recovery.py::test_concurrent_begin_session_serialize_via_lock`
    - later run timeout in `tests/unit/core/test_reset_caches.py::test_thesaurus_preload_after_reset_is_idempotent`
- conclusion: the publishing integration is green in the owned and merge-touching areas; the remaining full-suite blockers are upstream/environment issues, not introduced by the publishing branch work
