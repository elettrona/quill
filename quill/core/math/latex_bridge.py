"""LaTeX <-> MathML conversion bridge.

Only LaTeX -> MathML is a real conversion (the underlying ``latex2mathml``
library has no converse direction). MathML -> LaTeX recovers the original
source when it was embedded by :func:`latex_to_mathml`; MathML that never came
from LaTeX (e.g. an imported docx equation) has no LaTeX form to recover, so
:func:`mathml_to_latex` returns None for it rather than guessing.

``latex2mathml`` is the optional ``math`` extra (docs/planning/math.md, Tier
1-B); when it is not installed, :func:`latex_to_mathml` raises
:class:`LatexBridgeUnavailable` rather than importing at module load time.
