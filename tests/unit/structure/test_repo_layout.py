"""Structural guards for the repository tree (ORG-1).

These tests encode the "best-in-class repository tree" invariant: a new
contributor should be able to navigate the layout at a glance. Source lives
under ``quill/``, build tooling under ``scripts/``, internal helpers under
``tools/``, and tests under ``tests/`` — never as loose modules in the
repository root. The guards fail loudly if a stray module reappears at the root
so the cleanup cannot silently regress.
