"""Free / low-cost model catalog and classification (writing-first).

Pure, ``wx``-free helpers that classify provider models into cost tiers
(``free`` / ``low`` / ``flagship``), rank them for writing quality, and flag
whether a model is dependable for multi-step tool use (agents). This is the data
layer behind the "Use free AI (recommended)" onboarding path and the AI Hub
"Free" filter.

Design notes:

- **Free is derived, not hardcoded.** A model is free when the provider reports
  zero prompt+completion pricing, or (for OpenRouter) when its id ends in the
  documented ``:free`` suffix. The suffix is the durable signal, so the classifier
  keeps working as OpenRouter rotates its free line-up. A tiny curated allowlist
  only provides sensible *offline* defaults and writing-quality ordering.
- **Writing quality** is a coarse rank (bigger, stronger instruct models sort
  first) so the best available free model can be chosen without a benchmark.
- **Tool use** is conservative: very small models (<= 3B) are marked unreliable
  for the agent tool loop, which drives the graceful single-shot fallback.

This module builds on :mod:`quill.core.ai.model_manager` (local GGUF registry)
and reuses the already-audited ``ai_chat`` network helpers for live discovery.
