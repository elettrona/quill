# QUILL — Meet You Where You Are

### The screen-reader-first writing studio, built by the people who depend on it. This is the public beta, build 0.8.0 Beta 2.

*From Community Access. Free. Optional by design. Private by default. Yours to make quiet.*

This release document is the narrative companion to the **"0.8.0 Beta 2"**
section of `CHANGELOG.md` (the canonical, append-as-you-go log). It tracks what
changes in Beta 2 on top of Beta 1.

## What Beta 2 adds over Beta 1

Beta 2 carries forward everything in Beta 1 (private on-device speech,
document-to-audiobook production, braille proofreading, talking-book export,
guided proofing, multilingual narration, Mastodon posting, and the upgrade
hardening that makes betas safe to update). The list below is what is new,
fixed, or improved since Beta 1.

### Features

**Rich formatting that stays out of your way — hidden codes, spoken on demand.**
Beta 2's headline feature lets you apply real document formatting — **bold,
italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript/subscript, font family and point
size, text colour and highlight**, plus paragraph **alignment, line spacing,
indent, and named styles** — without ever seeing markup clutter in your editor.
The buffer stays clean, fast, plain text; the formatting rides along as invisible
codes. Apply it from the new **Format** menu (Font / Size / Align / Colour /
Highlight) or the accessible **Font...** dialog, and ask **"Describe formatting
at cursor"** to *hear* exactly what is in effect ("Arial, 14 point, centred,
bold"). An optional setting announces formatting changes as you move the caret.
The plain-text editor, undo, search, and AI all keep working on the same clean
text — nothing about your normal editing changes. RTF and Word documents
round-trip through this clean buffer and materialise back to real formatting on
export: **Word (.docx)** carries font, size, colour, highlight, and alignment via
a native writer (graceful Pandoc fallback if the optional `python-docx` extra is
absent), and **RTF** and **HTML** export carry the same. When a target format
genuinely cannot hold something, QUILL tells you before you commit rather than
dropping it silently.

**Keep your formatting in a plain-text file — Illuminations.** A plain `.txt` has
nowhere to store fonts, colours, or alignment, so saving formatted text as plain
text normally loses them. Beta 2 introduces the **Illumination** — named for the
decorative layer a scribe paints over a manuscript: the clean text is the
manuscript, and a small companion file, `yourfile.txt.illumination`, holds the
formatting beside it. The `.txt` stays genuinely plain everywhere else, and
reopening it *in QUILL* restores every font, colour, and alignment exactly. A new
**Settings → Editing → Saving formatted text as plain text** option lets you
choose to be asked each time, to always write an Illumination, or to save plain
and drop the formatting. If the `.txt` is edited elsewhere, QUILL notices the
mismatch and opens it plain rather than mis-applying old formatting; for one
self-contained file that keeps everything, save as Markdown, Word, or RTF.

**Re-read anything QUILL just said — the Spoken Echo.** Speech is fleeting: an
indent depth, a formatting description, a save result, a "no matches" — once
spoken, it is gone. The **Spoken Echo** captures the last twenty things QUILL
announced and shows them, newest first, in a read-only dialog you can arrow
through, re-read, and copy. Open it any time with **Alt+Shift+E** (Help → Show
Spoken Echo), and it works after *every* announcement, including ones produced by
ordinary editing keys like Tab. For the screen-reader gesture you already know,
**double-pressing** an informational command — Describe Formatting, Document
Summary, Context Help, or Announce Contrast — pops the Echo open instead of
re-speaking; the dedicated key remains the universal path. Toggle the
double-press behaviour with **Settings → Accessibility → Double-press to show the
Spoken Echo**.

**A Keyboard Manager that meets you halfway.** Customising shortcuts no longer
means remembering exact syntax or whether a key is free. The **Keymap Editor**
(Preferences → Keyboard) now searches two ways from a single box: type part of a
command's name to filter, or type a *shortcut* — `ctrl+alt+m`, `Control + Shift +
K`, or a QUILL chord like `quill, s` — and it tells you precisely which command
owns that key, or that it is unassigned and available. Spelling is forgiving:
`control`, `ctrl`, or `ctl`, modifiers in any order, any case, with macOS `Cmd`
kept distinct from `Ctrl`. Don't want to type it? Choose **Record Keys** and
press the combination. Assigning a key that is already taken names the command
that holds it — by its friendly title — and offers to move the key there for you,
rather than silently refusing. And **Run Diagnostics** audits your whole keymap
for duplicate shortcuts, bindings to commands that no longer exist, unreadable
bindings, and keys that are assigned but cannot actually fire, with a one-click
**Heal** that clears the bad entries and re-applies your shortcuts so menus and
keys line up again.

### Fixes

- **The portable build launches again, and opens documents.** Double-clicking
  `quill.exe` in the portable bundle now starts QUILL (the bundle-root launcher
  was orphaned from its runtime), and setting QUILL as the default app for Word
  (or other) documents now opens the file when you press Enter on it in your file
  manager — previously nothing happened.
- **The AI Hub opens instead of crashing.** Activating the AI Hub on the 0.7.0
  line failed with a "lazy string" / lazy-loading error; it now opens to the
  provider/authorisation screen. (Community-Access/support #51, #53)
- **Far less double-spoken chatter.** "No misspellings found" was one of many
  actions QUILL spoke twice — once from the status bar (which already speaks) and
  again from a separate announcement. Across updates, GitHub, SSH, dictation, the
  copy tray, and profile switches, these now speak exactly once. (#728)
- **Report a Bug is keyboard-navigable again, and submitting no longer seems to
  lose your text** — you can Tab through the form, and QUILL reliably confirms the
  report was copied to your clipboard on submit for NVDA users. (#729)
- **No alarming "text-to-speech failed" when your screen reader is running.**
  QUILL's own SAPI voice is only a fallback for people with no screen reader; if
  it failed to start, QUILL spoke a scary "TTS engine failed" message (with a
  wrong "press F8" instruction) even though the screen reader was handling speech.
  That case is now logged quietly and not spoken — QUILL only speaks up when you
  genuinely have no other voice, pointing you to the real **Tools → Retry TTS
  Engine**. The SAPI voice also initialises correctly under a read-only install
  now (its helper cache moved to a writable per-user folder), so self-voicing
  works for those who rely on it. Relatedly, the screen-reader detection no longer
  flashes a brief console window that a braille display could announce.
- **A control-type choice for braille displays that start each line in cell
  two.** On a rich-text editor control, some braille displays show every line's
  first character in cell two — the same quirk long-time Word users will
  recognise. **Preferences → Accessibility → Editor control type (braille)** can
  switch the editor to **Plain edit, like Notepad** — a simple control that the
  rich control was only ever needed in place of for *read-only* views (#616), so
  an editable plain control still reads correctly. RichEdit 2.0 is offered as a
  middle option. The control-type change applies to documents opened after it
  (restart to apply everywhere).
- **Downloading Kokoro voices now shows its progress instead of dropping you back
  at the document.** Starting the Kokoro voice-pack download from Manage Voices
  appeared to do nothing: focus snapped back to the editor and the progress window
  was never announced, because it opened while the Manage Voices dialog was still
  closing. The download now opens after that dialog is fully gone, so the progress
  window presents and your screen reader announces it. Once the Kokoro models are
  present, the redundant 114 MB download button is hidden rather than offered
  again.

### Enhancements

- **Hear how deep your indentation is.** Tab / Shift+Tab can now speak the new
  indentation depth — "4 spaces", "8 spaces", "1 tab" — instead of "Indented
  lines", honouring your tabs-vs-spaces and indent-width settings. Toggle with
  **Announce indentation depth on Tab** (Settings → Accessibility).
- **Quieter dialogs, your choice.** A new **Announce entering and leaving dialogs**
  setting (Settings → Accessibility) turns off the spoken "Entered / Exited *name*
  dialog" cues for people whose screen reader already announces dialogs.
- **Jump straight to an open document.** With several documents open, press
  **Alt+1** through **Alt+9** (and **Alt+0** for the tenth) to go directly to that
  document by its position, instead of cycling with Ctrl+Tab. If nothing is open
  at that position, QUILL tells you and stays put. The Window menu also lists your
  open documents with these shortcuts shown beside them, and the keys are
  remappable in the Keymap Editor.
- **Quieter Read Aloud for screen-reader users.** While Read Aloud played, QUILL
  selected each sentence in the editor to follow along — which made your screen
  reader announce the selection ("...selected") over QUILL's chosen voice. This
  follow-along is now **off by default**, so the cursor stays put and only the
  Read Aloud voice is heard. Sighted and low-vision users who want the cursor to
  track what is being read can turn it back on with the new **Move cursor to
  follow Read Aloud** setting (Settings → Read Aloud).
- **Portable installs update to the portable build, not the installer.** Check for
  Updates now recognises when you are running the portable bundle and offers the
  portable **.zip** for that release instead of pushing the Windows installer at
  you. The download lands in your updates folder with an **Open folder** button so
  you can swap it into place; installed copies keep getting the installer exactly
  as before.

## Release mechanics (do not announce yet)

Per the active release hold, the repo stays on Beta 1 labels and the update feed
stays where it is. No version bump, tag, push, or feed change until explicitly
approved. See `RELEASE.md` for the tag-time checklist.
