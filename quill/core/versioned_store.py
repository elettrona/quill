"""Reusable load/migrate/backup/resave for QUILL's versioned persistence stores.

This is the scalable backbone of the release-to-release persistence contract.
Every user-state file (settings today; keymap and feature flags as they adopt
it; any future store) follows the same three rules:

1. Defaults live in code.
2. Disk stores only the user's *delta* from those defaults, stamped with a
   schema/epoch version.
3. On load, a file that predates the current shape is backed up and rewritten
   to the canonical shape once, so changed/added defaults reach existing users
   while their customizations are preserved.

Rather than re-implement that dance per store, a store supplies four small
callables and gets the whole contract -- including the recoverable
pre-migration backup -- for free. Adding a new store is then: define defaults,
write ``parse``/``serialize``, declare ``is_legacy``, and call
:func:`load_with_migration`. Bumping a schema is: change ``serialize`` (and any
field-rename step inside ``parse``) and raise the version; legacy files migrate
and back up automatically.

Pure model code -- no ``wx`` imports.

    Parameters mirror the contract:

    * ``parse`` turns a raw on-disk dict (any historical shape) into the
      validated domain object, refilling anything missing with code defaults.
    * ``serialize`` turns the domain object into the canonical on-disk dict (the
      delta + version stamp). ``serialize(parse(raw))`` is the "what the file
      should look like now" form.
    * ``is_legacy`` reports whether ``raw`` predates the current schema, i.e. a
      real migration (not just a cosmetic rewrite) is happening and the original
      is worth backing up.
    * ``default`` builds the all-defaults object for a missing or unreadable
      file -- which is intentionally *not* created on disk on read.

    When the on-disk form already equals the canonical form, nothing is written
    (no churn). Otherwise the file is rewritten to the canonical form; if it was
    legacy, the original is snapshotted first via
    :func:`quill.core.migration_backup.backup_before_migration`. Persistence is
    best-effort: a read-only or locked file never blocks startup -- the valid
    object is already in memory and cleanup retries next launch.
